    "title":"Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects via\n  Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning",
    "abstract":"Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due\nto the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an\nalternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and\nversatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the\nhard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to\nregular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the\npolicy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end\nlearning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for\nany target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data\ncollection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning\nmethod with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data.\nWith the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and\nnon-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within\n2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data\ncollection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific\npolicies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error\nbeing 2.676 mm and 1.902 degrees.",

    "title":"Stealing Training Data from Large Language Models in Decentralized\n  Training through Activation Inversion Attack",
    "abstract":"Decentralized training has become a resource-efficient framework to\ndemocratize the training of large language models (LLMs). However, the privacy\nrisks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential\ninclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper\nidentifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from\ntraining data in decentralized training, and proposes \\textit{activation\ninversion attack} (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow\ndataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public\ndatasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to\nreconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized\ntraining. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly\navailable datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training\nto AIA. These findings highlight the urgent need to enhance security measures\nin decentralized training to mitigate privacy risks in training LLMs.",
