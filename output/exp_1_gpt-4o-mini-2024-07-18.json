    "title":"Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects via\n  Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning",
    "abstract":"Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due\nto the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an\nalternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and\nversatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the\nhard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to\nregular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the\npolicy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end\nlearning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for\nany target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data\ncollection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning\nmethod with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data.\nWith the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and\nnon-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within\n2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data\ncollection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific\npolicies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error\nbeing 2.676 mm and 1.902 degrees.",

    "title":"Stealing Training Data from Large Language Models in Decentralized\n  Training through Activation Inversion Attack",
    "abstract":"Decentralized training has become a resource-efficient framework to\ndemocratize the training of large language models (LLMs). However, the privacy\nrisks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential\ninclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper\nidentifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from\ntraining data in decentralized training, and proposes \\textit{activation\ninversion attack} (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow\ndataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public\ndatasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to\nreconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized\ntraining. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly\navailable datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training\nto AIA. These findings highlight the urgent need to enhance security measures\nin decentralized training to mitigate privacy risks in training LLMs.",

    "title":"Economic Rationality under Specialization: Evidence of Decision Bias in\n  AI Agents",
    "abstract":"In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT\ndemonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human\nlevel in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this\nfinding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as\nbiotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore\nwhether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent\nto that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that\nwhen agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making\nbehavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as\nincreased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference),\ndecreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision\ndeviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized\nbasic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across\nmultiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization\nand economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI\ndecision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across\nvarious scenarios.",

    "title":"SAM2Act: Integrating Visual Foundation Model with A Memory Architecture\n  for Robotic Manipulation",
    "abstract":"Robotic manipulation systems operating in diverse, dynamic environments must\nexhibit three critical abilities: multitask interaction, generalization to\nunseen scenarios, and spatial memory. While significant progress has been made\nin robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization\nto complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based\npolicy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations\nfrom large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average\nsuccess rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and\ndemonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3%\nperformance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2,\nwhich incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to\nenhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent\ntasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial\nmemory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive\nperformance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and\npushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.
