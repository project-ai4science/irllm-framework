    "b_abstract":" Establishing detailed relationships between transnormal systems of different\ntypes and their behaviors under covering maps, this paper presents a\nclassification of transnormal systems on compact 3-manifolds in the sense of\nequivalence. For CPC transnormal systems, we show that the ambient manifolds\nmust be locally isometric to one of six standard geometries up to equivalence.\nWe also find some equivalence classes containing no CPC transnormal system,\nhighlighting a critical distinction between isoparametric foliations and CPC\ntransnormal systems, which has not been previously addressed in the literature.",

    "c_abstract":" Detecting the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in particulate pipe\nsystems remains a complex issue in fluid dynamics, often requiring\nsophisticated and costly experimental apparatus. This research presents an\ninnovative streak visualization method designed to offer a simple and robust\napproach to identify transitional turbulent patterns in particulate pipe flows\nwith neutrally buoyant particles. The technique employs a laser arrangement and\na low-cost camera setup to capture particle-generated streaks within the fluid,\nenabling real-time observation of flow patterns. Validation of the proposed\nmethod was conducted through comparison with established techniques like\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and pressure drop measurements, confirming its\naccuracy and reliability. Experiments demonstrate the streak visualization\nmethod's capacity to differentiate between laminar, transitional, and turbulent\nflow regimes by analyzing the standard deviation of streak angles. The method\nis especially efficient at low particle concentration, ie precisely where other\nmore established methods become less effective. Furthermore, this technique\nenables us to identify a critical Reynolds number using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence built on the statistical distribution of streak angles, which is\nconsistent with previous studies.\n  Because it is effective at low concentrations and robust, this streak\nvisualization technique opens new perspectives for the characterization of\nparticulate pipe flows not only in the confines of the laboratory but also in\nless controlled industrial multi-phase flows where determining the laminar or\nturbulent nature of the flow is a prerequisite for flowmeter calibration.",

Although modern data processing systems embrace\nserverless storage, such as Amazon S3, they continue to manage their compute\nresources as servers. This is challenging for unpredictable workloads, leaving\nclusters often underutilized. Recent research shows the potential of serverless\ncompute resources, such as cloud functions, for elastic data processing, but\nalso sees limitations in performance robustness and cost efficiency for long\nrunning workloads. These challenges require holistic approaches across the\nsystem stack. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no end-to-end\ndata processing system built entirely on serverless infrastructure. In this\npaper, we present Skyrise, our effort towards building the first fully\nserverless SQL query processor. Skyrise exploits the elasticity of its\nunderlying infrastructure, while alleviating the inherent limitations with a\nnumber of adaptive and cost-aware techniques. We show that both Skyrise's\nperformance and cost are competitive to other cloud data systems for\nterabyte-scale queries of the analytical TPC-H benchmark.",
