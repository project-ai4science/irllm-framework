Also, the time-changed two parameter L\\'evy processes\nwith rectangular increments are studied. We introduce some time-changed\nvariants of the Poisson random field in plane with and without drift, and\nderive the associated fractional differential equations for their\ndistributions. Later, we consider some time-changed L\\'evy processes where the\ntime-changing components are two parameter Poisson random fields with drifts.\nMoreover, two parameter coordinatewise semigroup operators associated with some\nof the introduced processes are discussed.",

First, we present a criterion for convergence in\ntotal variation to a unique invariant measure, requiring only $TV$-eventual\ncontinuity of the semigroup at a single point. Second, we propose two new\ncriteria for asymptotic stability that require eventual continuity at a single\npoint. This localized condition is more practical and easier to check. To\nillustrate the advantages of our framework, we provide an explicit example\nwhere verifying eventual continuity at a single point is straightforward,\nwhereas establishing the corresponding global property is challenging.",

The\ntechnologically important exciton propagation across the interface and the\nimpact of CT excitons has remained in the dark so far. In this work, we\nmicroscopically investigate the spatiotemporal exciton dynamics in the\nexemplary hBN-encapsulated WSe$_2$-MoSe$_2$ lateral heterostructure and reveal\na highly interesting interplay of energy offset-driven unidirectional exciton\ndrift across the interface and efficient capture into energetically lower CT\nexcitons at the interface. This interplay triggers a counterintuitive thermal\ncontrol of exciton transport with a less efficient propagation at lower\ntemperatures - opposite to the behavior in conventional semiconductors. We\npredict clear signatures of this intriguing exciton propagation both in far-\nand near-field photoluminescence experiments.

    "b_abstract":" The KM3Net Collaboration has recently reported on the observation of a\nremarkable event KM3-230213A that could have been produced by an ultra high\nenergy cosmic neutrino. The origin of this event is still unclear. In\nparticular, the cosmogenic neutrino scenario is not favoured due to the\nnon-observation of a similar event by the IceCube detector, and most galactic\nscenarios are disfavoured as well. We show that the blazar PKS 0605-085 is a\nviable source of the KM3-230213A event. In particular, even though this blazar\nis located at 2.4$^{\\circ}$ from the KM3-230213A event, the association between\nthe blazar and the event is not unlikely due to a sizable direction systematic\nuncertainty of $\\approx 1.5^{\\circ}$ reported by the KM3Net Collaboration.\nFurthermore, we show that the observation of a $\\approx$72 PeV neutrino from\nPKS 0605-085 is entirely possible given that a $\\approx$7.5 PeV neutrino could\nhave been observed from another blazar TXS 0506+056. Finally, we consider\n$\\gamma$-ray constraints on the number of observable neutrino events and show\nthat for the case of the external photon field production mechanism these\nconstraints could be relaxed due to the often-neglected effect of the\nisotropisation of the hadronically-produced electrons in the magnetic field of\nthe blob. We encourage further multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS\n0605-085.",

    "c_abstract":" This study analyzes the multi-wavelength flaring activity of the distant flat\nspectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) OP 313 (z=0.997) during November 2023 to March\n2024, using data from Fermi-Large Area Telescope, Swift X-ray Telescope, and\nUltraviolet and Optical Telescope. The analysis highlights two significant very\nhigh energy(VHE) detection epochs and GeV gamma-ray flaring episodes, providing\ninsight into jet emission processes and radiative mechanisms. Key findings\ninclude broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) evolution, including\nenigmatic X-ray spectral changes. Modeling of the multi-wavelength SED with a\none-zone leptonic radiative processes attributes the emissions to synchrotron\nradiation, Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC), and External Compton (EC)\nmechanisms, with torus photons as the primary source for EC processes. The\nresults suggest that the gamma-ray emitting region lies outside the broad-line\nregion but within the dusty torus. Furthermore, we find that the radiated power\nis significantly smaller than the total jet power, suggesting that most of the\nbulk energy remains within the jet even after passing through the blazar\nemission zone. These findings advance our understanding of particle\nacceleration, jet dynamics, and photon field interactions in FSRQs.",

As any software, even chatbots are susceptible to bugs, and their\npervasiveness in our lives, as well as the underlying technological\nadvancements, call for tailored quality assurance techniques. However, test\ncase generation techniques for conversational chatbots are still limited. In\nthis paper, we present Chatbot Test Generator (CTG), an automated testing\ntechnique designed for task-based chatbots.

    "c_abstract":" Mutation testing may be used to guide test case generation and as a technique\nto assess the quality of test suites. Despite being used frequently, mutation\ntesting is not so commonly applied in the mobile world. One critical challenge\nin mutation testing is dealing with its computational cost. Generating mutants,\nrunning test cases over each mutant, and analyzing the results may require\nsignificant time and resources. This research aims to contribute to reducing\nAndroid mutation testing costs. It implements mutation testing operators\n(traditional and Android-specific) according to mutant schemata (implementing\nmultiple mutants into a single code file). It also describes an Android\nmutation testing framework developed to execute test cases and determine\nmutation scores. Additional mutation operators can be implemented in JavaScript\nand easily integrated into the framework. The overall approach is validated\nthrough case studies showing that mutant schemata have advantages over the\ntraditional mutation strategy (one file per mutant). The results show mutant\nschemata overcome traditional mutation in all evaluated aspects with no\nadditional cost: it takes 8.50% less time for mutant generation, requires\n99.78% less disk space, and runs, on average, 6.45% faster than traditional\nmutation. Moreover, considering sustainability metrics, mutant schemata have\n8,18% less carbon footprint than traditional strategy.",
