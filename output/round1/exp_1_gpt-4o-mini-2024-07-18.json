    "title":"Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects via\n  Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning",
    "abstract":"Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due\nto the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an\nalternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and\nversatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the\nhard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to\nregular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the\npolicy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end\nlearning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for\nany target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data\ncollection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning\nmethod with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data.\nWith the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and\nnon-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within\n2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data\ncollection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific\npolicies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error\nbeing 2.676 mm and 1.902 degrees.",

However, the privacy\nrisks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential\ninclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper\nidentifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from\ntraining data in decentralized training, and proposes \\textit{activation\ninversion attack} (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow\ndataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public\ndatasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to\nreconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized\ntraining. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly\navailable datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training\nto AIA.

    "abstract":"In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT\ndemonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human\nlevel in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this\nfinding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as\nbiotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore\nwhether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent\nto that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that\nwhen agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making\nbehavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as\nincreased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference),\ndecreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision\ndeviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized\nbasic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across\nmultiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization\nand economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI\ndecision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across\nvarious scenarios.",

    "abstract":"Robotic manipulation systems operating in diverse, dynamic environments must\nexhibit three critical abilities: multitask interaction, generalization to\nunseen scenarios, and spatial memory. While significant progress has been made\nin robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization\nto complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based\npolicy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations\nfrom large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average\nsuccess rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and\ndemonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3%\nperformance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2,\nwhich incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to\nenhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent\ntasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial\nmemory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive\nperformance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and\npushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.

Analyzing this specific morphology can uncover the underlying physics of\nstellar flare dynamics, particularly the plasma\nheating-evaporation-condensation process. While previous studies have mainly\nexamined peak-bump occurrences on M-dwarfs, this report extends the\ninvestigation to G-, K-, and M-type stars. We utilize the flare catalog\npublished by arXiv:2212.00993, encompassing 12,597 flares, detected by using\n$\\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ (TESS) observations. Our\nanalysis identifies 10,142 flares with discernible classical and complex\nmorphology, of which 197 ($\\sim1.9\\%$) exhibit the peak-bump feature. We delve\ninto the statistical properties of these TESS late-phase flares, noting that\nboth the amplitude and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration of both the\npeaks and bumps show positive correlations across all source-star spectral\ntypes, following a power law with indices 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.09 and 1.0 $\\pm$ 0.15,\nrespectively. Additionally, a negative correlation between flare amplitude and\nthe effective temperature of their host stars is observed.

Here, we present observations\nof plasma moving in a helical trajectory along a set of coronal loops formed\nfollowing the eruption of a CME on 2024 May 14. This helical motion was\nobserved in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images from the Solar Dynamic Observatory\n(SDO), which provides new insights into plasma properties in a set of\npost-eruption coronal loops. We utilize images from the SDO Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) instrument to track the helical motion of plasma and to\ncharacterize its speed, acceleration, and physical properties. Additionally, we\nexplore the evolution of the plasma density and temperature along the helical\nstructure using the differential emission measure technique. The helical\nstructure was visible in AIA for approximately 22 minutes, having a diameter of\n22 Mm, and a total trajectory of nearly 184 Mm. Analysis of the AIA\nobservations reveals that the plasma flow along this helical coronal loop\nexhibits speeds of 77-384 km s$^{-1}$ and temperatures ranging from 3.46 to\n10.2 MK. Additionally, the densities were estimated to be between 4.3.106 and\n1.55.107 cm-3, with an estimated magnetic field strength of 0.05-0.3 G.\nFollowing the launch of a CME, we find clear evidence for impulsive heating and\nexpansion of plasma that travels a helical trajectory along a set of\npost-eruption loops.

We use Prospector to infer\nthe stellar population from a combination of multi-wavelength photometry (HST,\nground-based, WISE) and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy.

Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow, obtained by GTC and Keck,\nidentified the redshift of $z = 1.6734$. EP240801a exhibits a burst duration of\n148 s in X-rays and 22.3 s in gamma-rays, with X-rays leading by 80.61 s.\nSpectral lag analysis indicates the gamma-ray signal arrived 8.3 s earlier than\nthe X-rays. Joint spectral fitting of EP\/WXT and Fermi\/GBM data yields an\nisotropic energy $E_{\\gamma,\\rm{iso}} = (5.57^{+0.54}_{-0.50})\\times\n10^{51}\\,\\rm{erg}$, a peak energy $E_{\\rm{peak}} =\n14.90^{+7.08}_{-4.71}\\,\\rm{keV}$, a fluence ratio $\\rm\nS(25-50\\,\\rm{keV})\/S(50-100\\,\\rm{keV}) = 1.67^{+0.74}_{-0.46}$, classifying\nEP240801a as an X-ray flash (XRF). The host-galaxy continuum spectrum, inferred\nusing Prospector, was used to correct its contribution for the observed\noutburst optical data. Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP\/FXT observations\nsuggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered:\ntwo-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model\nwith energy injection. Both three provide reasonable explanations. The\ntwo-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small\ninitial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the\nforward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model,\nEP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed\non-axis. Therefore, EP240801a can be interpreted as an off-beam (narrow) jet or\nan intrinsically weak GRB jet. Our findings provide crucial clues for\nuncovering the origin of XRFs.",

    "abstract":"Neural mapping schemes have become appealing approaches to deliver gap-free\nsatellite-derived products for sea surface tracers. The generalization\nperformance of these learning-based approaches naturally arises as a key\nchallenge. This is particularly true for satellite-derived ocean colour\nproducts given the variety of bio-optical variables of interest, as well as the\ndiversity of processes and scales involved. Considering region-specific and\nparameter-specific neural mapping schemes will result in substantial training\ncosts. This study addresses generalization performance of neural mapping\nschemes to deliver gap-free satellite-derived ocean colour products. We develop\na comprehensive experimental framework using real multi-sensor ocean colour\ndatasets for two regions (the Mediterranean Sea and the North Sea) and a\nrepresentative set of bio-optical parameters (Chlorophyll-a concentration,\nsuspended particulate matter concentration, particulate backscattering\ncoefficient). We consider several neural mapping schemes, and we report\nexcellent generalization performance across regions and bio-optical parameters\nwithout any fine-tuning using appropriate dataset-specific normalization\nprocedures. We discuss further how these results provide new insights towards\nthe large-scale deployment of neural schemes for the processing of\nsatellite-derived ocean colour datasets beyond case-study-specific\ndemonstrations.",

    "abstract":"Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is widely used for its rapid acquisition but\nsuffers from severe geometric distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities,\nparticularly along the phase encoding direction. Existing methods follow a\ntwo-step process: reconstructing blip-up\/down EPI images, then estimating B0,\nwhich can introduce error accumulation and reduce correction accuracy. This is\nespecially problematic in high B0 regions, where distortions align along the\nsame axis, making them harder to disentangle. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach that integrates Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) with a\nphysics-informed correction model to jointly estimate B0 inhomogeneities and\nreconstruct distortion-free images from rotated-view EPI acquisitions. INRs\noffer a flexible, continuous representation that inherently captures complex\nspatial variations without requiring predefined grid-based field maps. By\nleveraging this property, our method dynamically adapts to subject-specific B0\nvariations and improves robustness across different imaging conditions.\nExperimental results on 180 slices of brain images from three subjects\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of\nreconstruction quality and field estimation accuracy.",

The availability of open\nsoftware packages is making such analyses widely accessible, and especially\nwhen implemented in Python, easy to compare in terms of computational\nefficiency and reconstruction quality. In this contribution, I reconstruct\natomic phase shifts from convergent-beam electron diffraction maps of pristine\nmonolayer graphene, which is an ideal dose-robust uniform phase object,\nacquired on a Dectris ARINA detector installed in a Nion UltraSTEM 100 operated\nat 60 keV with a focused-probe convergence semi-angle of 34 mrad. For two\ndifferent recorded maximum scattering angle settings, I compare a range of\ndirect and iterative open-source phase reconstruction algorithms, evaluating\ntheir computational efficiency and tolerance to reciprocal-space binning and\nreal-space thinning of the data. The quality of the phase images is assessed by\nquantifying the variation of atomic phase shifts using a robust parameter-based\nmethod revealing an overall agreement with some notable differences in the\nabsolute magnitudes and the variation of the phases. Although such variation is\nnot a major issue when analyzing data with many identical atoms, it does put\nlimits on what level of precision can be relied upon for unique sites such as\ndefects or dopants, which also tend to be more dose-sensitive. Overall, these\nfindings and the accompanying open data and code provide useful guidance for\nthe sampling required for desired levels of phase precision, and suggest\nparticular care is required when relying on electron ptychography for\nquantitative analyses of atomic-scale electromagnetic properties.",

While extensive research has\ninvestigated bias in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit\nbias, leaving the more nuanced implicit biases largely unexplored. This paper\npresents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to\ninvestigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a\nnovel \"self-reflection\" based evaluation framework that operates in two phases:\nfirst measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment\nmethods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own\ngenerated content. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs\nacross multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a\nsubstantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases, where explicit\nbiases manifest as mild stereotypes while implicit biases show strong\nstereotypes. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying factors contributing to\nthis explicit-implicit bias inconsistency. Our experiments examine the effects\nof training data scale, model parameters, and alignment techniques. Results\nindicate that while explicit bias diminishes with increased training data and\nmodel size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Notably,\ncontemporary alignment methods (e.g., RLHF, DPO) effectively suppress explicit\nbias but show limited efficacy in mitigating implicit bias. These findings\nsuggest that while scaling up models and alignment training can address\nexplicit bias, the challenge of implicit bias requires novel approaches beyond\ncurrent methodologies.",

The study's results show a good agreement\nbetween the model and the implementation, even if some parts need to be refined\nto take specific algorithms into account. The key contribution is the\ndevelopment of an initial flexible energy model with finer granularity,\nenabling comparisons of energy use across various applications and contexts,\nand offering a comprehensive tool for optimizing 5G network energy consumption.",

    "abstract":"Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are implemented to\ninvestigate the energy cascade rate in compressible isothermal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Utilizing an exact law derived from the\nK\\'arm\\'an-Howarth equation, we examine the contributions of flux and non-flux\nterms to the cascade rate across a broad range of sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumbers, from subsonic to supersonic regimes and varying mean magnetic fields.\nCascade rates are computed using on-grid 3-D decomposition and two plasma\nincrement approaches: signed and absolute values. Anisotropy induced by strong\nmagnetic fields is analyzed through angular-dependent scaling of the cascade\nterms. Moreover, the increment calculation method significantly influences the\nrelative contributions of flux and non-flux terms, with absolute methods\ntending to overestimate the latter. These findings extend current studies of\ncompressible turbulence and offer critical insights into energy transfer\nmechanisms relevant to many astrophysical phenomena.",

    "title":"Voting Scheme to Strengthen Localization Security in Randomly Deployed\n  Wireless Sensor Networks",
    "abstract":"This work aspires to provide a trustworthy solution for target localization\nin adverse environments, where malicious nodes, capable of manipulating\ndistance measurements (i.e., performing spoofing attacks), are present, thus\nhindering accurate localization. Besides localization, its other goal is to\nidentify (detect) which of the nodes participating in the process are\nmalicious. This problem becomes extremely important with the forthcoming\nexpansion of IoT and smart cities applications, that depend on accurate\nlocalization, and the presence of malicious attackers can represent serious\nsecurity threats if not taken into consideration. This is the case with most\nexisting localization systems which makes them highly vulnerable to spoofing\nattacks. In addition, existing methods that are intended for adversarial\nsettings consider very specific settings or require additional knowledge about\nthe system model, making them only partially secure. Therefore, this work\nproposes a novel voting scheme based on clustering and weighted central mass to\nsecurely solve the localization problem and detect attackers. The proposed\nsolution has two main phases: 1) Choosing a cluster of suitable points of\ninterest by taking advantage of the problem geometry to assigning votes in\norder to localize the target, and 2) Attacker detection by exploiting the\nlocation estimate and basic statistics. The proposed method is assessed in\nterms of localization accuracy, success in attacker detection, and\ncomputational complexity in different settings. Computer simulations and\nreal-world experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, showing that it can accomplish an error\nreduction of $30~\\%$ and is capable of achieving almost perfect attacker\ndetection rate when the ratio between attacker intensity and noise standard\ndeviation is significant.",

    "abstract":"Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a crucial task that aims to correct\ncharacter errors in Chinese text. While conventional CSC focuses on character\nsubstitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character\nerrors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These\nerrors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or\nignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue\nlimits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce\nthe task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on\nall three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark\nby combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We\nextend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein\ndistance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based\nlarge language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our\nmethod enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times\nlarger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning.",

    "abstract":"The ever-growing availability of unlabeled data presents both opportunities\nand challenges for training artificial intelligence systems. While\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for\nextracting meaningful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data,\nexisting methods still struggle to adapt to the non-stationary, non-IID nature\nof real-world data streams without forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nRecent works have adopted a repeated cosine annealing schedule for large-scale\ncontinual pre-training; however, these schedules (1) inherently cause\nforgetting during the re-warming phase and (2) have not been systematically\ncompared to existing continual SSL methods. In this work, we systematically\ncompare the widely used cosine schedule with the recently proposed infinite\nlearning rate schedule and empirically find the latter to be a more effective\nalternative. Our extensive empirical evaluation across diverse image and\nlanguage datasets demonstrates that the infinite learning rate schedule\nconsistently enhances continual pre-training performance compared to a repeated\ncosine decay without being restricted to a fixed iteration budget. For\ninstance, in a small-scale MAE pre-training setup, it outperforms several\nstrong baselines from the literature. We then scale up our experiments to\nlarger MAE pre-training and autoregressive language model pre-training. Our\nresults show that the infinite learning rate schedule remains effective at\nscale, surpassing repeated cosine decay for both MAE pre-training and zero-shot\nLM benchmarks.",

In this study, to create an\noptimal control for Neural ODE-based recommendation, we introduce a new method\ncalled Graph Neural Controlled Differential Equations for Collaborative\nFiltering (CDE-CF). Our method improves the performance of the Graph ODE-based\nmethod by incorporating weight control in a continuous manner. To evaluate our\napproach, we conducted experiments on various datasets.

The prefill stage processes large numbers of input tokens in\nparallel, increasing computational load, while the decoding stage relies\nheavily on memory bandwidth due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs. Current\nhardware, such as GPUs, often fails to balance these demands, leading to\ninefficient utilization. While batching improves hardware efficiency, it delays\nresponse times, degrading Quality-of-Service (QoS). This disconnect between\nvendors, who aim to maximize resource efficiency, and users, who prioritize low\nlatency, highlights the need for a better solution. To address this, we propose\nADOR, a framework that automatically identifies and recommends hardware\narchitectures tailored to LLM serving. By leveraging predefined architecture\ntemplates specialized for heterogeneous dataflows, ADOR optimally balances\nthroughput and latency. It efficiently explores design spaces to suggest\narchitectures that meet the requirements of both vendors and users. ADOR\ndemonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving 2.51x higher QoS\nand 4.01x better area efficiency compared to the A100 at high batch sizes,\nmaking it a robust solution for scalable and cost-effective LLM serving.",

    "abstract":"In the task of reference-based image inpainting, an additional reference\nimage is provided to restore a damaged target image to its original state. The\nadvancement of diffusion models, particularly Stable Diffusion, allows for\nsimple formulations in this task. However, existing diffusion-based methods\noften lack explicit constraints on the correlation between the reference and\ndamaged images, resulting in lower faithfulness to the reference images in the\ninpainting results. In this work, we propose CorrFill, a training-free module\ndesigned to enhance the awareness of geometric correlations between the\nreference and target images. This enhancement is achieved by guiding the\ninpainting process with correspondence constraints estimated during inpainting,\nutilizing attention masking in self-attention layers and an objective function\nto update the input tensor according to the constraints. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CorrFill significantly enhances the performance of multiple\nbaseline diffusion-based methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, by\nemphasizing faithfulness to the reference images.",

The server updates the global model\nthrough over-the-air model-difference aggregation from the local devices over a\nnoisy multiple-access fading channel. We consider the practical scenario where\ninformation on both the local loss functions and the channel states is delayed,\nand each local device is under a time-varying power constraint. We propose\nConstrained Over-the-air Model Updating with Delayed infOrmation (COMUDO),\nwhere a new lower-and-upper-bounded virtual queue is introduced to counter the\ndelayed information and control the hard constraint violation. We show that its\nlocal model updates can be efficiently computed in closed-form expressions.\nFurthermore, through a new Lyapunov drift analysis, we show that COMUDO\nprovides bounds on the dynamic regret, static regret, and hard constraint\nviolation. Simulation results on image classification tasks under practical\nwireless network settings show substantial accuracy gain of COMUDO over\nstate-of-the-art approaches, especially in the low-power region.",

Further, we propose a Video Motion\nConsistency Refinement (VMCR) module that computes the gradient of pixel-wise\nand frequency-wise losses to enhance visual consistency and temporal\nsmoothness. Extensive experiments, including quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations on videos of varying lengths (\\textit{e.g.}, 3\\times and 6\\times\nlonger), demonstrate that our method effectively integrates with existing video\ndiffusion models, producing coherent, high-fidelity long videos superior to\nprevious approaches.",

One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset,\nwhich has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that\nallowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various\nskills within a unified framework.

To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench\nExtra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM\nreasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that\nprobes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased\ndifficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average\naccuracy of 9.8\\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\\% for the best\nreasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and\nhighlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in\nLLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https:\/\/github.com\/google-deepmind\/bbeh.",

    "abstract":"Different variants of the Hadron Resonance Gas model have been used to\ndescribe the hadronic phase of strongly interacting matter. HRG model is\nimproved by including repulsive interaction through the inclusion of excluded\nvolume in Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (EVHRG) model. Here, the EVHRG\nmodel is further improved by incorporating unequal radii of hadrons which has\nbeen named as Modified Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (MEVHRG) model and\nalso by taking their Lorentz contraction in Lorentz contracted MEVHRG model,\nnamely, LMEVHRG model. Another way of incorporating the repulsive interactions\nin the HRG model is through the introduction of a mean-field potential. This is\ndone in the HRG mean-field (HRGMF) model where the single particle energies are\nmodified by a density dependent term. Both the inclusion of unequal radii and\nthe Lorentz contraction have significant effects on the thermodynamic\nquantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The centre of mass energy\ndependence of some thermodynamic quantities in presence of repulsive\ninteraction has been studied. Our study clearly indicates that proper modelling\nof repulsive interaction among hadrons is very important to explain the\nthermodynamic quantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The effect\nof static magnetic field in HRG and EVHRG models by the means of Landau levels\nhas also been investigated. The vacuum part of the pressure, in presence of\nmagnetic field, has been properly renormalised. The magnetic field is found to\neffect the thermodynamic quantities and the susceptibilities significantly. The\nelectric charge susceptibility is influenced more strongly by the magnetic\nfield than the baryon susceptibility. The total magnetization of hadronic\nmatter is found to be positive.",

Leveraging this structure, we proposed a new MP algorithm, termed\nthe SAMP algorithm, which has two novel components. First, we present a new and\nrobust model order detection with theoretical guarantees. Second, we present an\nefficient estimation of signal amplitudes. We show empirically that the SAMP\nalgorithm significantly outperforms the standard MP method, particularly in\nchallenging conditions with closely-spaced frequencies and low Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR) values, approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for a broad\nSNR range.

    "abstract":"Context. Galactic halos host faint substructures, such as stellar streams and\nshells, which provide insights into the hierarchical assembly history of\ngalaxies. To date, such features have been identified in external galaxies by\nvisual inspection. However, with the advent of larger and deeper surveys and\nthe associated increase in data volume, this methodology is becoming\nimpractical. Aims. Here we aim to develop an automated method to detect low\nsurface brightness features in galactic stellar halos. Moreover, we seek to\nquantify its performance when considering progressively more complex data sets,\nincluding different stellar disc orientations and redshifts. Methods. We\ndevelop the Stream Automatic Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks,\nSAD-CNN. This tool is trained on mock surface brightness maps obtained from\nsimulations of the Auriga Project. The model incorporates transfer learning,\ndata augmentation and balanced datasets to optimise its detection capabilities\nat surface brightness limiting magnitudes ranging from 27 to 31 mag arcsec^-2.\nResults. The iterative training approach, coupled with transfer learning,\nallowed the model to adapt to increasingly challenging datasets, achieving\nprecision and recall metrics above 80% in all considered scenarios. The use of\na well-balanced training dataset is critical for mitigating biases, ensuring\nthat the CNN accurately distinguishes between galaxies with and without\nstreams. Conclusions. SAD-CNN is a reliable and scalable tool for automating\nthe detection of faint substructures in galactic halos. Its adaptability makes\nit well-suited for future applications, including the analysis of data from\nupcoming large astronomical surveys (such as LSST, JWT).",

    "abstract":"DUSt3R has recently shown that one can reduce many tasks in multi-view\ngeometry, including estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, reconstructing\nthe scene in 3D, and establishing image correspondences, to the prediction of a\npair of viewpoint-invariant point maps, i.e., pixel-aligned point clouds\ndefined in a common reference frame. This formulation is elegant and powerful,\nbut unable to tackle dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce\nthe concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), extending standard point maps to\nsupport 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object\ntracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key intuition is that, when time is\nintroduced, there are several possible spatial and time references that can be\nused to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of such\ncombinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the sub tasks\nmentioned above. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real\ndata and evaluate it across diverse benchmarks for video depth prediction,\ndynamic point cloud reconstruction, 3D scene flow and object pose tracking,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract":"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable\npotential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based\nagents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While\nrecent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these\nissues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated,\nas well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In\nthis study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a\nnovel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective\nprocess that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and\nsibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the\nsearch tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process.\nFurthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to\nfacilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting\ncomprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is\nimplemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to\nactual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed\nearlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6%\nabsolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML\nagents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.\nResource available at https:\/\/github.com\/jokieleung\/I-MCTS",

    "abstract":"Quantifying the evolution and complexity of materials is of importance in\nmany areas of science and engineering, where a central open challenge is\ndeveloping experimental complexity measurements to distinguish random\nstructures from evolved or engineered materials. Assembly Theory (AT) was\ndeveloped to measure complexity produced by selection, evolution and\ntechnology. Here, we extend the fundamentals of AT to quantify complexity in\ninorganic molecules and solid-state periodic objects such as crystals, minerals\nand microprocessors, showing how the framework of AT can be used to distinguish\nnaturally formed materials from evolved and engineered ones by quantifying the\namount of assembly using the assembly equation defined by AT. We show how\ntracking the Assembly of repeated structures within a material allows us\nformalizing the complexity of materials in a manner accessible to measurement.\nWe confirm the physical relevance of our formal approach, by applying it to\nphase transformations in crystals using the HCP to FCC transformation as a\nmodel system. To explore this approach, we introduce random stacking faults in\nclosed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how\nAssembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of\nclosed-packed structures with random or engineered faults, demonstrating its\nutility in distinguishing engineered materials from randomly structured ones.\nOur results have implications for the study of pre-genetic minerals at the\norigin of life, optimization of material design in the trade-off between\ncomplexity and function, and new approaches to explore material\ntechnosignatures which can be unambiguously identified as products of\nengineered design.",

However, existing SFL frameworks would\nfrequently upload smashed data and download gradients between the server and\neach client, leading to severe communication overheads. To address this issue,\nthis work proposes a novel communication-and-computation efficient SFL\nframework, which allows dynamic model splitting (server- and client-side model\ncutting point selection) and broadcasting of aggregated smashed data gradients.\nWe theoretically analyze the impact of the cutting point selection on the\nconvergence rate of the proposed framework, revealing that model splitting with\na smaller client-side model size leads to a better convergence performance and\nvise versa. Based on the above insights, we formulate an optimization problem\nto minimize the model convergence rate and latency under the consideration of\ndata privacy via a joint Cutting point selection, Communication and Computation\nresource allocation (CCC) strategy. To deal with the proposed mixed integer\nnonlinear programming optimization problem, we develop an algorithm by\nintegrating the Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) with convex optimization\nmethods.

However, current\nstate-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches have three key limitations:\nhandling requests with varying difficulty using homogeneous SSMs, lack of\nrobust support for batch processing, and insufficient holistic optimization for\nboth speculation and verification phases. In this paper, we introduce SPIN, an\nefficient LLM inference serving system based on speculative decoding, designed\nto address these challenges through three main innovations. First, SPIN\nimproves token speculation by using multiple heterogeneous SSMs, with a\nlearning-based algorithm for SSM selection that operates without prior\nknowledge of request difficulty. Second, SPIN employs a request decomposition\nmethod to minimize batching overhead during LLM verification. Finally, SPIN\norchestrates speculation and verification phases by pipelining their executions\non GPUs to achieve further acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSPIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a\nperformance increase of approximately 2.28X.",

    "abstract":"In recent years, research on humanoid robots has garnered increasing\nattention. With breakthroughs in various types of artificial intelligence\nalgorithms, embodied intelligence, exemplified by humanoid robots, has been\nhighly anticipated. The advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhave significantly improved the motion control and generalization capabilities\nof humanoid robots. Simultaneously, the groundbreaking progress in large\nlanguage models (LLM) and visual language models (VLM) has brought more\npossibilities and imagination to humanoid robots. LLM enables humanoid robots\nto understand complex tasks from language instructions and perform long-term\ntask planning, while VLM greatly enhances the robots' understanding and\ninteraction with their environment. This paper introduces\n\\textcolor{magenta}{Trinity}, a novel AI system for humanoid robots that\nintegrates RL, LLM, and VLM. By combining these technologies, Trinity enables\nefficient control of humanoid robots in complex environments.

    "abstract":"We demonstrate that the electroweak baryogenesis can be realized in the\nextended Standard Model with sequential fourth generation fermions (SM4). The\nsolution to the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the fermion and Higgs\nmasses indicates that fourth generation quarks $t'$ and $b'$ with the Yukawa\ncouplings above the threshold $g_Q^c\\approx 9.1$ form condensates. This\ncritical coupling, greater than the value $g_Y^f\\approx 7$ at the ultraviolet\nfixed point of the renormalization-group evolution in the SM4, implies the\nexistence of an electroweak symmetric phase at a high energy. The $t'$ and $b'$\nYukawa couplings evolve as the energy decreases, and exceed $g_Q^c$ at a lower\nscale. The Higgs potential with the dynamical symmetry breaking effect from\nheavy quark condensates, the one-loop correction from the heavy scalars formed\nby $t'$ and $b'$ quarks and the temperature-dependent contribution from fourth\ngeneration leptons allow the first-order phase transition characterized by the\nratio $\\phi_c\/T_c\\approx 0.9$, where $\\phi_c$ is the location of the Higgs\npotential minimum at the critical temperature $T_c$.

For privacy protection, the\nprevalent solution adopts distributed learning for fine-tuning and integrates\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce users' computational load. However, as the\nnumber of users increases, numerous users simultaneously communicate with the\nserver, and multiple server-side models concurrently execute on the server,\nleading to significant communication congestion and memory pressure. In this\npaper, we propose a split learning (SL) scheme for fine-tuning LLM in wireless\nnetworks, which involves one cloud server, a small number of edge servers, and\nmultiple users. Specifically, the pre-trained model and LoRA adapters are\ndivided into three parts and deployed across the cloud, edge, and user sides.\nThe training process follows the sequence of user, edge, and cloud, with\nforward and backward propagation achieved by transmitting activation and\ngradient. In each round, all edge servers and an equivalent number of users\ntrain in parallel, and only the LoRA adapters are updated. At the end of each\nround, all edge-side and user-side LoRA adapters are uploaded to the cloud for\naggregation. Extensive simulation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can\nreduce peak memory usage up to 74% compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.",

It further enhances practicality through three key\nimprovements: supporting secure inter-contract interactions, providing a key\nrotation scheme that enforces forward and backward secrecy even in the event of\nTEE breaches, and enabling full compatibility with existing blockchains without\naltering the user interaction model. To validate its feasibility, we prototype\nRaceTEE using Intel SGX and Ethereum, demonstrating its applicability across\nvarious use cases and evaluating its performance.",

Their formation\nand evolution remain debated, with interactions with satellite galaxies and\naccretion streams proposed as key contributors. Malin 1 has multiple\nsatellites, including Malin 1A, Malin 1B, and the newly reported Malin 1C,\nalong with eM1 at 350 kpc. Additionally, it exhibits two giant stellar streams,\nthe largest extending 200 kpc, likely linked to past interactions.\n  Aims. We investigate the orbital dynamics of Malin 1's satellites and their\nrelationship with the observed stellar streams, testing their consistency with\ndifferent formation scenarios.\n  Methods. We constructed gravitational potentials using optical and H I\nrotation curve data, using stellar, gaseous, and dark matter components. We\nexplored a wide parameter space to see if the candidate progenitors of the\nstellar streams could have originated from past interactions, testing both NFW\nand isothermal halo profiles.\n  Results. Among ten explored scenarios, seven produced bound orbital\nsolutions. The isothermal halo model, with a virial mass of 3.8 x 10^12 solar\nmasses and a virial radius of approximately 323 kpc, favors bound satellite\norbits more than the NFW model (1.7 x 10^12 solar masses). We find that eM1\nprobably had a pericenter passage 1.3 Gyr ago, Malin 1A around 1.4 Gyr ago, and\nMalin 1B's leading arm may be experiencing one now. Malin 1C displays both\nleading and trailing arms. Furthermore, we identify three unbound orbital\nsolutions that could link eM1, Malin 1A, or Malin 1B to the streams.\n  Conclusions. The alignment of satellites and streams supports the idea that\npast interactions contributed to Malin 1's morphology, enriched its gas\nreservoir, and influenced the development of its extended disk, providing\ninsights into the evolution of gLSBGs.",

    "title":"High Gain and Broadband Metalens Antenna for Terahertz Communication",
    "abstract":"Terahertz (THz) metalens antennas with compact planar structures have\ndemonstrated potential applications in enhancing gain and efficiency through\nbeam convergence. However, the practical applications of THz communications\nusing metalens antennas are impeded due to the lack of collaborative\nenhancement in both gain and operation bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a\nhigh gain and broadband metalens antenna and demonstrate its application for\nTHz communication. This metalens is constructed using a 'sandwich' structure\ncomprising a V-shaped antenna, dielectric layer, and grating, where the\nresonant design facilitates high polarization conversion efficiency and full\nphase modulation across a 0 to 2{\\pi} range. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the designed metalens achieve a maximum gain of 36.1 dBi and aperture\nefficiency of 56.28 % at 0.244 THz with 3 dB gain bandwidth exceeding 33.0 GHz.\nFurthermore, we developed a prototype system utilizing metalens antennas for\nTHz communication, which reduced the bit error rate (BER) by three orders of\nmagnitude compared with horn antennas and achieved a maximum data rate of 100\nGbps. This proposed metalens offer a high-gain, compact solution for achieving\nhigh data rate THz communications, driving advancements in 6G communication\nnetwork.",

    "abstract":"The four-roll mill has been traditionally viewed as a device generating\nsimple extensional flow with a central stagnation point. Our systematic\ninvestigation using a two-relaxation-time regularized lattice Boltzmann\n(TRT-RLB) model reveals unexpected richness in the flow physics, identifying\ntwo previously unreported supercritical bifurcation modes: a quadrifoliate\nvortex mode featuring four symmetrical counter-rotating vortices, and a\ndumbbell-shaped quad-vortex mode where vortices detach from but remain\nsymmetric about the stagnation point. The numerical framework, representing the\nfirst successful extension of TRT-RLB method to power-law fluid dynamics,\nenables comprehensive mapping of flow characteristics across Reynolds numbers\n($1 \\leq Re \\leq 50$), power-law indices ($0.7 \\leq n \\leq 1.3$), and geometric\nconfigurations. The transition from quadrifoliate vortex mode exhibits distinct\npathways depending on the power-law index: at relatively small $n$, the flow\nundergoes a direct supercritical bifurcation to simple extensional flow, while\nat relatively large $n$, it evolves through an intermediate dumbbell-shaped\nstate. Among geometric parameters, the roller radius $r$ emerges as the\ndominant factor controlling bifurcation points and vortex dimensions, whereas\nthe roller-container gap $\\delta$ exerts minimal influence on flow regimes. The\ntransitions between flow modes can be precisely characterized through the\nevolution of vortex dimensions and velocity gradients at the stagnation point,\nproviding quantitative criteria for flow regime identification. These findings\nenrich our fundamental understanding of bifurcation phenomena in extensional\ndevices and provide quantitative guidelines for achieving desired flow patterns\nin four-roll mill applications.",

    "abstract":"In many real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL), deployed\npolicies have varied impacts on different stakeholders, creating challenges in\nreaching consensus on how to effectively aggregate their preferences.\nGeneralized $p$-means form a widely used class of social welfare functions for\nthis purpose, with broad applications in fair resource allocation, AI\nalignment, and decision-making. This class includes well-known welfare\nfunctions such as Egalitarian, Nash, and Utilitarian welfare. However,\nselecting the appropriate social welfare function is challenging for\ndecision-makers, as the structure and outcomes of optimal policies can be\nhighly sensitive to the choice of $p$. To address this challenge, we study the\nconcept of an $\\alpha$-approximate portfolio in RL, a set of policies that are\napproximately optimal across the family of generalized $p$-means for all $p \\in\n[-\\infty, 1]$. We propose algorithms to compute such portfolios and provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the trade-offs among approximation factor, portfolio\nsize, and computational efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in\nsummarizing the policy space induced by varying $p$ values, empowering\ndecision-makers to navigate this landscape more effectively.",

    "abstract":"Exciton-polaritons emerging from the interaction of photons and excitons in\nthe strong coupling regime are intriguing quasiparticles for the potential\nexchange of energy during light-matter interaction processes such as light\nharvesting.

The size of this splitting\ncorrelates with the coupling strength between the exciton and the photonic\nmodes. In this work, we investigate this coupling between excitons and photonic\nwaveguide modes excited simultaneously in thin-film flakes of the\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$. Using a Photoemission electron\nmicroscope, we are able to extract the dispersion of the transversal electric\nand magnetic modes propagating through these flakes as well as extract the\nenergy splitting.

    "abstract":"Coverage optimization generally involves deploying a set of facilities to\nbest satisfy the demands of specified points, with broad applications in fields\nsuch as location science and sensor networks. Recent applications reveal that\nthe subset site selection coupled with continuous angular parameter\noptimization can be formulated as Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems (MVOPs).\nMeanwhile, high-fidelity discretization and visibility analysis significantly\nincrease computational cost and complexity, evolving the MVOP into an Expensive\nMixed-Variable Optimization Problem (EMVOP). While canonical Evolutionary\nAlgorithms have yielded promising results, their reliance on numerous fitness\nevaluations is too costly for our problem. Furthermore, most surrogate-assisted\nmethods face limitations due to their reliance on regression-based models. To\naddress these issues, we propose the RankNet-Inspired Surrogate-assisted Hybrid\nMetaheuristic (RI-SHM), an extension of our previous work. RI-SHM integrates\nthree key components: (1) a RankNet-based pairwise global surrogate that\ninnovatively predicts rankings between pairs of individuals, bypassing the\nchallenges of fitness estimation in discontinuous solution space; (2) a\nsurrogate-assisted local Estimation of Distribution Algorithm that enhances\nlocal exploitation and helps escape from local optima; and (3) a fitness\ndiversity-driven switching strategy that dynamically balances exploration and\nexploitation. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively handle\nlarge-scale coverage optimization tasks of up to 300 dimensions and more than\n1,800 targets within desirable runtime. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms\nfor EMVOPs, RI-SHM consistently outperforms them by up to 56.5$\\%$ across all\ntested instances.",

    "abstract":"The electronic band structure of Weyl semimetals possesses pairs of linear\nband crossings, called Weyl nodes, characterized by opposite chirality charges\nassociated with each node. The momentum space position of the nodes can reverse\nacross a planar interface and these host Fermi-arc-like bound states, in\naddition to scattering states. We show that a magnetic interstitial layer can\ntune these states in three distinct ways. The electrostatic potential and one\nof the in-plane magnetic potential components control the shape of the bound\nstate Fermi-arcs. For moderate values of the same in-plane magnetic potential\nelectrons are spin-filtered across the interface, while both the in-plane\nmagnetic components and the electrostatic potential control the transmission of\nelectrons. The ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic components can be\nused to turn on or turn off the magnetic potential effects, since the latter\ndoes not affect the interface states. The tunability arises from spin-momentum\nlocking and chirality reversal at the interface. Thus, the effects can mix or\ninterchange depending on the specific material but the states will remain\ntunable.",

    "abstract":"We use a sample of Type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) spectra in order to\ninvestigate which atomic processes are responsible for some observed properties\nof the FeII emission lines and how they are connected with macroscopic physical\ncharacteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated\nrelative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative\nstrengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We\ninvestigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV\nFeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$\/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into\ntwo large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities\nare in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent\n(FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than\ntheoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII\nmodel, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted\nindependently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that\nproduce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their\ncorrelations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of\nFeII$_{incons}$\/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$\/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the\nEddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that\nboth ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines,\nwhich is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical\nFeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the\nFeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an\nincrease in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of\nthe process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a\ncomplex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical\nconditions.",

    "abstract":"Most reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for the decision-making of\nautonomous driving consider safety as a reward instead of a cost, which makes\nit hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk\npreference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be\neither conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a\nhuman-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level\ndecision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)\nthat incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed\nby a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level\nof RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints\nbased on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To\nfilter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism\nthat pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks\nwith surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the\neffectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample\nefficiency. Simulation experiments in multiple levels of traffic densities show\nthat our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing\ntraffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware\nconstraints in CMDP and action shielding, we can not only adjust the safety\nlevel of the final policy but also reduce safety violations during the training\nstage, proving a promising solution for online learning in real-world\nenvironments.",

Since physical noise in near-term\nboson sampling devices is inevitable, precise characterization of the boundary\nof noise rates where the classical intractability of boson sampling is\nmaintained is crucial for quantum computational advantage using near-term\ndevices. In this work, we identify the level of partial distinguishability\nnoise that upholds the classical intractability of boson sampling. We find that\nboson sampling with on average $O(\\log N)$ number of distinguishable photons\nout of $N$ input photons maintains the equivalent complexity to the ideal boson\nsampling case. By providing strong complexity theoretical evidence of the\nclassical intractability of noisy boson sampling, we expect that our findings\nwill enable one to ultimately demonstrate quantum computational advantage with\nnoisy boson sampling experiments in the near future.",

    "abstract":"The main goal of this article is to establish H\\\"older stability estimates\nfor the Calder\\'on problem related to a relativistic wave equation. The\nprincipal novelty of this article is that the partial differential equation\n(PDE) under consideration depends on three unknown potentials, namely a\ntemporal dissipative potential $A_0$, a spatial vector potential $A$ and an\nexternal potential $\\Phi$. Moreover, the PDE is posed in an infinite waveguide\ngeometry $\\Omega=\\omega\\times\\mathbb{R}$ and not on a bounded domain. For our\nproof it is essential that the potentials are time-independent as a key tool in\nthis work are pointwise estimates for the Radon transform of the vector\npotential $\\mathcal{A}=(A_0,\\mathrm{i} A)$ and external potential $\\Phi$.\nFurthermore, the demonstrated stability estimates hold for a wide range of\n$H^s$ Sobolev scales and a main contribution is to explicitly determine the\ndependence of the involved constants and the H\\\"older exponent on the Sobolev\nexponents of the potentials $A_0,A$ and $\\Phi$.",

    "abstract":"In the modular superconducting quantum processor architecture, high-fidelity,\nmeter-scale microwave interconnect between processor modules is a key\ntechnology for extending system size beyond constraints imposed by device\nmanufacturing equipment, yield, and signal delivery. While there have been many\ndemonstrations of remote state transfer between modules, these relied on\ntomographic experiments for benchmarking, but this technique does not reliably\nseparate State Preparation And Measurement (SPAM) error from error per state\ntransfer. Recent developments based on randomized benchmarking provide a\ncompatible theory for separating these two errors. In this work, we present a\nmodule-to-module interconnect based on Tunable-Coupling Qubits (TCQs) and\nbenchmark, in a SPAM error tolerant manner, a remote state transfer fidelity of\n0.988 across a 60cm long coplanar waveguide (CPW). The state transfer is\nimplemented via superadiabatic transitionless driving method, which suppresses\nintermediate excitation in internal modes of CPW. We also introduce the frame\ntracking technique to correct unintended qubit phase rotations before and after\nthe state transfers, which enables the SPAM-error-tolerant benchmarking of the\nstate transfers. We further propose and construct a remote CNOT gate between\nmodules, composed of local CZ gates in each module and remote state transfers,\nand report a high gate fidelity of 0.933 using randomized benchmarking method.\nThe remote CNOT construction and benchmarking we present is a more complete\nmetric that fully characterizes the module to module link operation going\nforward as it more closely represents interconnect operation in a circuit.",

This includes direct\nradiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated\nwith photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to\ndust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high\nresolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular\nline measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H$\\alpha$-based region sizes to\nestimate the strength of radiation pressure in $\\approx 18,000$ HII regions\nacross 19 nearby star-forming galaxies.

    "abstract":"After exploring the infrared softness diagram to characterize the hardness of\nthe incident ionizing radiation in star-forming regions, we exploit the\navailability of high-excitation lines in the same spectral regime to explore\nits use for studying the narrow-line regions in AGN. We adapted the IR softness\ndiagram to consider very high-excitation lines, such as [Ne V] 14.3,24.3 $\\mu$m\nor [O IV] 25.9$\\mu$m. The measured emission-line ratios were included as inputs\nfor the code HCm-Teff-IR, in order to provide a quantification for both the\nionization and the $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ parameters. The latter is sensitive to the\nspectral shape of the incident continuum in AGN. We applied this to a large AGN\nsample including different spectral types with available Spitzer\/IRS,\nHerschel\/PACS and\/or SOFIA\/FIFI-LS mid-IR spectroscopic observations. The\ncombination of the ([Ne II] 12.8 $\\mu$m+[Ne III] 15.6$\\mu$m)\/[Ne V] 14.3$\\mu$m\nand [O III] 52,88 $\\mu$m\/[O IV] 25.9$\\mu$m emission line ratios is a robust\nproxy for the shape of the ionizing continuum in AGN. An alternative based on\nthe [S III] 18.7 $\\mu$m+[S IV] 10.5$\\mu$m lines can be used instead. The\ninclusion of very high-excitation lines in HCm-Teff-IR, to derive both\n$\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$ and $U$ for the studied sample, points to a bimodal\ndistribution of galaxies.

This result is consistent\nwith the existence of two very marked AGN populations., one with a softer\nionizing continuum, possibly dominated by a radiatively efficient accretion\ndisk in bright Seyfert nuclei.

Accurately modeling these dynamics allows domain experts to optimize\nstrategies in interactive scenarios, such as turn-based sports like badminton.\nIn multi-agent systems, agent behaviors are interdependent, and traditional\nMulti-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) methods often fail to capture these\ncomplex interactions. Correlated policies, which account for opponents'\nstrategies, are essential for accurately modeling such dynamics. However, even\nmethods designed for learning correlated policies, like CoDAIL, struggle in\nStackelberg games due to their asymmetric decision-making, where leaders and\nfollowers cannot simultaneously account for each other's actions, often leading\nto non-correlated policies. Furthermore, existing MAIL methods that match\noccupancy measures or use adversarial techniques like GAIL or Inverse RL face\nscalability challenges, particularly in high-dimensional environments, and\nsuffer from unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncorrelated policy occupancy measure specifically designed for Stackelberg games\nand introduce the Latent Stackelberg Differential Network (LSDN) to match it.\nLSDN models two-agent interactions as shared latent state trajectories and uses\nmulti-output Geometric Brownian Motion (MO-GBM) to effectively capture joint\npolicies. By leveraging MO-GBM, LSDN disentangles environmental influences from\nagent-driven transitions in latent space, enabling the simultaneous learning of\ninterdependent policies. This design eliminates the need for adversarial\ntraining and simplifies the learning process. Extensive experiments on\nIterative Matrix Games and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that\nLSDN can better reproduce complex interaction dynamics than existing MAIL\nmethods.",

In recent years, solver-based\nprotocols have emerged as an alternative venue aiming to introduce competition\nfor routing, access to offchain liquidity, and thereby improve end-user\nexecution. Currently, these solver auctions are hosted on opaque backends, and\nthe extent of price improvement they provide to end users remains unclear.\n  We conduct an empirical study of the execution welfare that these protocols\nbring to users by analyzing data across different asset profiles (USDC-WETH and\nPEPE-WETH). Our results indicate that, compared to vanilla routing through\nUniswap V2 or V3, solver-based protocols effectively enhance execution welfare\nfor end users on DEXes within certain trade size ranges. This effect is most\npronounced with USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, and somewhat less significant\nwith PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset.\n  Additionally, we identify execution welfare discrepancies across solver-based\nplatforms (e.g., CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, UniswapX), revealing potential\ninefficiencies due to solver market structure, variations in liquidity profile\nand inventory depth among solvers. These insights highlight both the advantages\nand challenges of solver-based trading, underscoring its role in improving\nexecution outcomes while raising concerns about market concentration and\ncompetition dynamics.",

    "title":"Plasma treated metals after H- irradiation and its effect on vacuum\n  breakdown behaviour",
    "abstract":"Vacuum breakdown in accelerator structures is a critical challenge that\noccurs under high electric fields. In environments subjected to hydrogen ion\nirradiation or high beam losses, such as in Radio-Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ),\nresidual hydrocarbons from the vacuum may result in carbon contamination of the\nmetal surfaces from charged particle induced cracking. Under these conditions,\nit has been assessed that surface carbon contamination leads to a decrement of\nthe surface electric field holding properties. This study extends the latest\nresearch by exploring the efficacy of Oxygen Plasma Cleaning (OPC) on metal\nelectrodes irradiated by low energy hydrogen ion beam with the purpose of\nreducing surface carbon contamination. OPC treatment has been employed on\ndifferent metals, namely copper beryllium (CuBe2), oxygen-free copper (Cu-OFE),\nand stainless steel (SS316LN). Treated electrodes have been tested for electric\nfield performance in a DC pulsed system and results compared with\nnon-irradiated electrodes and irradiated ones without OPC treatment. The study\nindicates a significant reduction in carbon contamination by OPC, enough to\nallow irradiated materials to achieve performances comparable with the electric\nfield strength of raw surfaces. Moreover, it has been observed that stainless\nsteel samples had some alteration in the surface chemistry that enhanced the\nmaterials ability to sustain high electric fields while decreasing vacuum\narcing events. Notably, OPC treated SS316LN electrodes surpassed the\nperformance value of untreated ones, demonstrating the potential of plasma\ntreatments in extending the operational performance of accelerator components.",

Dominator wins if the vertices he\nselected during the game form a dominating set of $G$, while Staller wins if\nshe can prevent Dominator from achieving this goal. Given a positive integer\n$b$, Dominator's threshold, $\\textrm{a}_b$, is the minimum $a$ such that\nDominator wins the $(a,b)$-biased game on $G$ when he starts the game.\nSimilarly, $\\textrm{a}'_b$ denotes the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins\nwhen Staller starts the $(a,b)$-biased game.

The specific fairness we consider is called\n'strong transition fairness', given by a subset of edges of one of the players,\nwhich asks the player to take fair edges infinitely often if their source nodes\nare visited infinitely often.\n  We show that when fairness is imposed on player 1, these games fall within\nthe class of previously studied omega-regular mean-payoff and energy games.

For all variants of fair mean-payoff and fair energy\n(under unknown initial credit) games, we give pseudo-polynomial algorithms to\ncompute the winning regions of both players. Additionally, we analyze the\nstrategy complexities required for these games. Our work is the first to extend\nthe study of strong transition fairness, as well as gadget-based approaches, to\nthe quantitative setting.

    "abstract":"In recent years, research on humanoid robots has garnered significant\nattention, particularly in reinforcement learning based control algorithms,\nwhich have achieved major breakthroughs. Compared to traditional model-based\ncontrol algorithms, reinforcement learning based algorithms demonstrate\nsubstantial advantages in handling complex tasks. Leveraging the large-scale\nparallel computing capabilities of GPUs, contemporary humanoid robots can\nundergo extensive parallel training in simulated environments. A physical\nsimulation platform capable of large-scale parallel training is crucial for the\ndevelopment of humanoid robots. As one of the most complex robot forms,\nhumanoid robots typically possess intricate mechanical structures, encompassing\nnumerous series and parallel mechanisms. However, many reinforcement learning\nbased humanoid robot control algorithms currently employ open-loop topologies\nduring training, deferring the conversion to series-parallel structures until\nthe sim2real phase. This approach is primarily due to the limitations of\nphysics engines, as current GPU-based physics engines often only support\nopen-loop topologies or have limited capabilities in simulating\nmulti-rigid-body closed-loop topologies. For enabling reinforcement\nlearning-based humanoid robot control algorithms to train in large-scale\nparallel environments, we propose a novel training method LiPS. By\nincorporating multi-rigid-body dynamics modeling in the simulation environment,\nwe significantly reduce the sim2real gap and the difficulty of converting to\nparallel structures during model deployment, thereby robustly supporting\nlarge-scale reinforcement learning for humanoid robots.",

    "abstract":"The advent of the foundation model era has sparked significant research\ninterest in leveraging pre-trained representations for continual learning (CL),\nyielding a series of top-performing CL methods on standard evaluation\nbenchmarks. Nonetheless, there are growing concerns regarding potential data\ncontamination during the pre-training stage. Furthermore, standard evaluation\nbenchmarks, which are typically static, fail to capture the complexities of\nreal-world CL scenarios, resulting in saturated performance. To address these\nissues, we describe CL on dynamic benchmarks (CLDyB), a general computational\nframework based on Markov decision processes for evaluating CL methods\nreliably. CLDyB dynamically identifies inherently difficult and\nalgorithm-dependent tasks for the given CL methods, and determines challenging\ntask orders using Monte Carlo tree search. Leveraging CLDyB, we first conduct a\njoint evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art CL methods, leading to a set of\ncommonly challenging and generalizable task sequences where existing CL methods\ntend to perform poorly. We then conduct separate evaluations of individual CL\nmethods using CLDyB, discovering their respective strengths and weaknesses.

    "abstract":"General relativity (GR) is a highly successful theory that describes gravity\nas a geometric phenomenon. The gravitational redshift, a classic test of GR,\ncan potentially be violated in alternative gravity theories, and experimental\ntests on this effect are crucial for our understanding of gravity. In this\npaper, considering the space-ground clock comparisons with free-space links, we\ndiscuss a high-precision Doppler cancellation-based measurement model for\ntesting gravitational redshift. This model can effectively reduce various\nsources of error and noise, reducing the influences of the first-order Doppler\neffect, atmospheric delay, Shapiro delay, etc. China's Lunar Exploration\nProject (CLEP) is proposed to equip the deep-space H maser with a daily\nstability of $2\\times10^{-15}$, which provides an approach for testing\ngravitational redshift. Based on the simulation, we analyze the space-ground\nclock comparison experiments of the CLEP experiment, and simulation analysis\ndemonstrates that under ideal condition of high-precision measurement of the\nonboard H-maser frequency offset and drift, the CLEP experiment may reach the\nuncertainty of $3.7\\times10^{-6}$ after a measurement session of 60 days. Our\nresults demonstrate that if the issue of frequency offset and drift is solved,\nCLEP missions have a potential of testing the gravitational redshift with high\naccuracy.

    "abstract":"Understanding how individuals perceive and recall information in their\nnatural environments is critical to understanding potential failures in\nperception (e.g., sensory loss) and memory (e.g., dementia). Event\nsegmentation, the process of identifying distinct events within dynamic\nenvironments, is central to how we perceive, encode, and recall experiences.\nThis cognitive process not only influences moment-to-moment comprehension but\nalso shapes event specific memory. Despite the importance of event segmentation\nand event memory, current research methodologies rely heavily on human\njudgements for assessing segmentation patterns and recall ability, which are\nsubjective and time-consuming. A few approaches have been introduced to\nautomate event segmentation and recall scoring, but validity with human\nresponses and ease of implementation require further advancements. To address\nthese concerns, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate event\nsegmentation and assess recall, employing chat completion and text-embedding\nmodels, respectively. We validated these models against human annotations and\ndetermined that LLMs can accurately identify event boundaries, and that human\nevent segmentation is more consistent with LLMs than among humans themselves.\nUsing this framework, we advanced an automated approach for recall assessments\nwhich revealed semantic similarity between segmented narrative events and\nparticipant recall can estimate recall performance. Our findings demonstrate\nthat LLMs can effectively simulate human segmentation patterns and provide\nrecall evaluations that are a scalable alternative to manual scoring. This\nresearch opens novel avenues for studying the intersection between perception,\nmemory, and cognitive impairment using methodologies driven by artificial\nintelligence.",

    "abstract":"We report upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Karl J. Jansky Very\nLarge Array radio observations of a low-mass merging galaxy cluster PSZ2\nG181.06+48.47. This exceptional galaxy cluster hosts two megaparsec-scale\ndiffuse sources, symmetrically located with respect to the cluster center and\nseparated by about 2.6 Mpc in projection. We detect these low surface\nbrightness sources in our new high-frequency observations (0.3-2 GHz) and\nclassify them as radio relics associated with merger-driven shock fronts. The\nsouthwest relic exhibits an inverted morphology and shows evidence of spectral\nsteepening in the post-shock region, potentially tracing a high Mach number\nshock ($\\sim 4$) under the framework of diffusive shock acceleration. The\nnortheast relic is found to be highly polarized with a 22% average polarization\nfraction at 1.5 GHz and aligned magnetic field vectors. Its spectral and\npolarization properties, along with the presence of a nearby tailed galaxy,\nsupport re-acceleration scenarios. The merger axis defined by the two relics is\ntilted by $\\sim 45$ degree with respect to the plane of the sky, which implies\nan unprecedented physical separation of $\\sim 3.5$ Mpc. We also detect a\npossible faint radio halo, suggesting weak turbulence in the central cluster\nregion. We conclude that the faint double relics can be best explained by two\noutward moving shock waves in which particles are (re-)accelerated and that the\ncluster is in an evolved merger state. PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 presents a unique\nopportunity to investigate particle acceleration in low mass systems\ncharacterized by large relic separations.",

These\npatterns persist even when the texts are rewritten, translated, or summarized\nby an external LLM, suggesting that they are also encoded in the semantic\ncontent. Additionally, we leverage LLM as judges to generate detailed,\nopen-ended descriptions of each model's idiosyncrasies. Finally, we discuss the\nbroader implications of our findings, particularly for training on synthetic\ndata and inferring model similarity.

    "abstract":"In the theory of integral weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth,\ntwo key differential operators, the Bol operator and the shadow operator, play\na fundamental role. Harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth canonically split\ninto two parts, and each operator controls one of these parts. A third\noperator, called the flipping operator, exchanges the role of these two parts.\nMaass--Poincar\\'e series (of parabolic type) form a convenient basis of\nnegative weight harmonic Maass forms of manageable growth, and flipping has the\neffect of negating an index. Recently, there has been much interest in locally\nharmonic Maass forms defined by the first author, Kane, and Kohnen. These are\nlifts of Poincar\\'e series of hyperbolic type, and are intimately related to\nthe Shimura and Shintani lifts. In this note, we prove that a similar property\nholds for the flipping operator applied to these Poincar\\'e series.",

    "title":"Are your apps accessible? A GCN-based accessibility checker for low\n  vision users",
    "abstract":"Context: Accessibility issues (e.g., small size and narrow interval) in\nmobile applications (apps) lead to obstacles for billions of low vision users\nin interacting with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Although GUI\naccessibility scanning tools exist, most of them perform rule-based check\nrelying on complex GUI hierarchies. This might make them detect invisible\nredundant information, cannot handle small deviations, omit similar components,\nand is hard to extend. Objective: In this paper, we propose a novel approach,\nnamed ALVIN (Accessibility Checker for Low Vision), which represents the GUI as\na graph and adopts the Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to label\ninaccessible components. Method: ALVIN removes invisible views to prevent\ndetecting redundancy and uses annotations from low vision users to handle small\ndeviations. Also, the GCN model could consider the relations between GUI\ncomponents, connecting similar components and reducing the possibility of\nomission. ALVIN only requires users to annotate the relevant dataset when\ndetecting new kinds of issues. Results: Our experiments on 48 apps demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ALVIN, with precision of 83.5%, recall of 78.9%, and\nF1-score of 81.2%, outperforming baseline methods. In RQ2, the usefulness is\nverified through 20 issues submitted to open-source apps. The RQ3 also\nillustrates the GCN model is better than other models. Conclusion: To\nsummarize, our proposed approach can effectively detect accessibility issues in\nGUIs for low vision users, thereby guiding developers in fixing them\nefficiently.",

    "abstract":"Large transformers have demonstrated remarkable success, making it necessary\nto compress these models to reduce inference costs while preserving their\nperfor-mance. Current compression algorithms prune transformers at fixed\ncompression ratios, requiring a unique pruning process for each ratio, which\nresults in high computational costs. In contrast, we propose pruning of\npretrained transformers at any desired ratio within a single pruning stage,\nbased on a differential inclusion for a mask parameter. This dynamic can\ngenerate the whole regularization solution path of the mask parameter, whose\nsupport set identifies the network structure. Therefore, the solution path\nidentifies a Transformer weight family with various sparsity levels, offering\ngreater flexibility and customization. In this paper, we introduce such an\neffective pruning method, termed SPP (Solution Path Pruning). To achieve\neffective pruning, we segment the transformers into paired modules, including\nquery-key pairs, value-projection pairs, and sequential linear layers, and\napply low-rank compression to these pairs, maintaining the output structure\nwhile enabling structural compression within the inner states. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on various well-known transformer backbones have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of SPP.",

First, we present\na simple hypothetical example and a real-world application among heart failure\npatients using Medicare claims data. We next demonstrate how the optimal\ntreatment rule improves the absolute risk in a hypothetical, three-modifier\nsetting. Finally, we identify an optimal treatment rule that optimizes the time\nto outcome in a real-world heart failure setting. In both examples, we compare\nthe average time to death under the optimized, tailored treatment rule with the\naverage time to death under a universal treatment rule to show the benefit of\nprecision medicine methods. The improvement under the optimal treatment rule in\nthe real-world setting is greatest (additional ~9 days under the tailored rule)\nfor survival time free of heart failure readmission.",

    "abstract":"We report the observations of J=1-0 of HCN, HCO+, H13CO+, and H13CN, HC3N\n(J=11-10) emission towards 135 massive star-forming clumps, as part of the\nATOMS (ALMA Three-millimeter Observations of Massive Star-forming regions)\nSurvey. We present the integrated intensity probability distribution function\nfor these molecular tracers, modeled as a combination of a log-normal\ndistribution and a power-law tail. The molecular line luminosities for the\npower-law tail segment, Lmol(p), have been calculated. We have investigated the\ncorrelation between the bolometric luminosity, Lbol, and the power-law part of\nthe molecular line luminosity, Lmol(p). Our findings suggest that the scaling\nrelationships between Lbol and Lmol(p) for HCN and HCO+ are sublinear,\nindicating that these molecules might not be the most effective tracers for the\ndense gas. In contrast, H13CN and HC3N exhibit a nearly linear relationship\nbetween Lbol and Lmol(p), indicating that they can well trace gravitationally\nbound dense gas. The ratios of Lbol-to-Lmol(p), serving as indicators of star\nformation efficiency within massive star-forming clumps, exhibit a weak\nanti-correlation with the power-law index in the I-PDF. In addition, the star\nformation efficiency is also weakly anti-correlated with the exponent U of the\ncorresponding equivalent density distribution. Our results implie that clumps\nwith substantial gas accumulation may still display low star formation\nefficiencies.",

    "abstract":"The European Space Agency's Euclid mission will observe approximately 14,000\n$\\rm{deg}^{2}$ of the extragalactic sky and deliver high-quality imaging for\nmany galaxies. The depth and high spatial resolution of the data will enable a\ndetailed analysis of stellar population properties of local galaxies. In this\nstudy, we test our pipeline for spatially resolved SED fitting using synthetic\nimages of Euclid, LSST, and GALEX generated from the TNG50 simulation. We apply\nour pipeline to 25 local simulated galaxies to recover their resolved stellar\npopulation properties. We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid,\nLSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS\nmodels in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust\nattenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of\nflat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of\nmass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and\nsimulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any\nof the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new\npriors then significantly improve the measurements of mass-weighted age and $Z$\ncompared to results obtained without priors, but they may play an excessive\nrole compared to the data in determining the outcome when no UV data is\navailable. The spatially resolved SED fitting method is powerful for mapping\nthe stellar populations of galaxies with the current abundance of high-quality\nimaging data. Our study re-emphasizes the gain added by including\nmultiwavelength data from ancillary surveys and the roles of priors in Bayesian\nSED fitting. With the Euclid data alone, we will be able to generate complete\nand deep stellar mass maps of galaxies in the local Universe, thus exploiting\nthe telescope's wide field, NIR sensitivity, and high spatial resolution.",

    "abstract":"Today's autonomous vehicles rely on a multitude of sensors to perceive their\nenvironment. To improve the perception or create redundancy, the sensor's\nalignment relative to each other must be known. With Multi-LiCa, we present a\nnovel approach for the alignment, e.g. calibration. We present an automatic\nmotion- and targetless approach for the extrinsic multi LiDAR-to-LiDAR\ncalibration without the need for additional sensor modalities or an initial\ntransformation input. We propose a two-step process with feature-based matching\nfor the coarse alignment and a GICP-based fine registration in combination with\na cost-based matching strategy. Our approach can be applied to any number of\nsensors and positions if there is a partial overlap between the field of view\nof single sensors. We show that our pipeline is better generalized to different\nsensor setups and scenarios and is on par or better in calibration accuracy\nthan existing approaches. The presented framework is integrated in ROS 2 but\ncan also be used as a standalone application. To build upon our work, our\nsource code is available at: https:\/\/github.com\/TUMFTM\/Multi_LiCa.",

    "title":"PathVQ: Reforming Computational Pathology Foundation Model for Whole\n  Slide Image Analysis via Vector Quantization",
    "abstract":"Computational pathology and whole-slide image (WSI) analysis are pivotal in\ncancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs\npresents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology\nfoundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS]\ntoken representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is\nrefereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial\ndetails from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that\nleveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly\n200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To\naddress this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature,\nwhich efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a\ndecoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a\n64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we\nemploy a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ\nreconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL)\nsupervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the\nquantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a\nprogressive convolutional module and slide-level SSL to extract representations\nwith rich spatial-information for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive evaluations\non multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in WSI analysis. Code will be available soon.",

This strategy involves maintaining\ntwo models with identical structures but different initial parameter\nconfigurations, which collaborate with each other to select easy samples with\nprediction confidence exceeding a set threshold for training. As training\nprogresses, the strategy gradually lowers the threshold, allowing more samples\nto participate, enhancing the model's ability to recognize objects from easy to\nhard. Before applying the CPL-BC strategy to train the FBOD models, we\ninitially trained the two FBOD models to equip them with the capability to\nassess the difficulty level of flying bird object samples. Experimental results\non two different datasets of flying bird objects in surveillance videos\ndemonstrate that, compared to other model learning strategies, CPL-BC\nsignificantly improves detection accuracy, verifying the effectiveness and\nadvancement of this method.",

    "title":"Detecting dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov\n  Telescope Array Observatory",
    "abstract":"Numerous observations confirm the existence of dark matter (DM) at\nastrophysical and cosmological scales. Theory and simulations of galaxy\nformation predict that DM should cluster on small scales in bound structures\ncalled sub-halos or DM clumps. While the most massive DM sub-halos host\nbaryonic matter, less massive, unpopulated sub-halos could be abundant in the\nMilky Way (MW), as well and yield high-energy gamma rays as final products of\nDM annihilation. Recently, it has been highlighted that the brightest halos\nshould also have a sizeable extension in the sky. In this study, we examine the\nprospects offered by the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), a\nnext-generation gamma-ray instrument, for detecting and characterizing such\nobjects. Previous studies have primarily focused on high-latitude observations;\nhere, we assess the potential impact of the CTAO's Galactic Plane Survey, which\nwill provide unprecedentedly deep survey data for the inner five degrees of the\nGalactic plane. Our modeling accounts for tidal effects on the sub-halo\npopulation, examining the conditions under which DM sub-halos can be detected\nand distinguished from conventional astrophysical sources. We find that regions\na few degrees above or below the Galactic plane offer the highest likelihood\nfor DM sub-halo detection. For an individual sub-halo -- the brightest from\namong various realizations of the MW subhalo population -- we find that\ndetection at the 5$\\sigma$ level is achievable for an annihilation cross\nsection of $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\sim 3\\times10^{-25}$ cm$^3$\/s for\nTeV-scale DM annihilating into $b\\bar{b}$. For a full population study,\ndepending on the distribution and luminosity model of Galactic sub-halos, yet\nunconstrained cross sections in the range $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\sim\n10^{-23}-10^{-22}$ cm$^3$\/s for TeV DM candidates are necessary for the\nbrightest sub-halos to be detected.",

    "abstract":"Artificial intelligence has achieved notable results in sign language\nrecognition and translation. However, relatively few efforts have been made to\nsignificantly improve the quality of life for the 72 million hearing-impaired\npeople worldwide. Sign language translation models, relying on video inputs,\ninvolves with large parameter sizes, making it time-consuming and\ncomputationally intensive to be deployed. This directly contributes to the\nscarcity of human-centered technology in this field. Additionally, the lack of\ndatasets in sign language translation hampers research progress in this area.\nTo address these, we first propose a cross-modal multi-knowledge distillation\ntechnique from 3D to 1D and a novel end-to-end pre-training text correction\nframework. Compared to other pre-trained models, our framework achieves\nsignificant advancements in correcting text output errors. Our model achieves a\ndecrease in Word Error Rate (WER) of at least 1.4% on PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14T\ndatasets compared to the state-of-the-art CorrNet. Additionally, the TensorFlow\nLite (TFLite) quantized model size is reduced to 12.93 MB, making it the\nsmallest, fastest, and most accurate model to date. We have also collected and\nreleased extensive Chinese sign language datasets, and developed a specialized\ntraining vocabulary. To address the lack of research on data augmentation for\nlandmark data, we have designed comparative experiments on various augmentation\nmethods. Moreover, we performed a simulated deployment and prediction of our\nmodel on Intel platform CPUs and assessed the feasibility of deploying the\nmodel on other platforms.",

    "title":"Practical Modulo Sampling: Mitigating High-Frequency Components",
    "abstract":"Recovering signals within limited dynamic range (DR) constraints remains a\ncentral challenge for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To prevent data\nloss, an ADCs DR typically must exceed that of the input signal. Modulo\nsampling has recently gained attention as a promising approach for addressing\nDR limitations across various signal classes. However, existing methods often\nrely on ideal ADCs capable of capturing the high frequencies introduced by the\nmodulo operator, which is impractical in real-world hardware applications. This\npaper introduces an innovative hardware-based sampling approach that addresses\nthese high-frequency components using an analog mixer followed by a Low-Pass\nFilter (LPF). This allows the use of realistic ADCs, which do not need to\nhandle frequencies beyond the intended sampling rate. Our method eliminates the\nrequirement for high-specification ADCs and demonstrates that the resulting\nsamples are equivalent to those from an ideal high-spec ADC. Consequently, any\nexisting modulo recovery algorithm can be applied effectively. We present a\npractical hardware prototype of this approach, validated through both\nsimulations and hardware recovery experiments. Using a recovery method designed\nto handle quantization noise, we show that our approach effectively manages\nhigh-frequency artifacts, enabling reliable modulo recovery with realistic\nADCs. These findings confirm that our hardware solution not only outperforms\nconventional methods in high-precision settings but also demonstrates\nsignificant real-world applicability.",

Traditional transformer-based approaches face challenges due to token\nlimitations and the complexity of reasoning over large tables.

    "abstract":"The task of text-to-image generation has encountered significant challenges\nwhen applied to literary works, especially poetry. Poems are a distinct form of\nliterature, with meanings that frequently transcend beyond the literal words.\nTo address this shortcoming, we propose a PoemToPixel framework designed to\ngenerate images that visually represent the inherent meanings of poems. Our\napproach incorporates the concept of prompt tuning in our image generation\nframework to ensure that the resulting images closely align with the poetic\ncontent. In addition, we propose the PoeKey algorithm, which extracts three key\nelements in the form of emotions, visual elements, and themes from poems to\nform instructions which are subsequently provided to a diffusion model for\ngenerating corresponding images. Furthermore, to expand the diversity of the\npoetry dataset across different genres and ages, we introduce MiniPo, a novel\nmultimodal dataset comprising 1001 children's poems and images. Leveraging this\ndataset alongside PoemSum, we conducted both quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations of image generation using our PoemToPixel framework. This paper\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and offers a fresh perspective\non generating images from literary sources.",

Here, we consider the\ntension response to a sudden extension of a membrane tether, and report a\nquantitative signature of dynamic tension relaxation, which up to now is\nmissing. We present a theory based on tension diffusion leading to a prediction\nof power-law decay in time of the force holding the tether, with a\nmaterial-independent exponent of 1\/3.

    "abstract":"Swift J1727.8--1613 is a black hole X-ray binary that differs from other\nblack hole X-ray binaries in that it has an extra hard component in addition to\na reflection component. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous\nInsight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was in the hard and\nhard intermediate states. For the presentation of the extra components, we\ninvestigate the correlation between the relxill parameters. We find that the\ncorrelation between the spectral index and the reflection fraction is\nconsistent with MAXI J1820+070 when the jet dominates the reflection. This\nprovides the second sample to have such a correlation during an outburst.\nInterestingly, when the reflection component is attributed to the corona, the\nspectral fit results in a small reflection fraction and the correlation between\nthe spectral index and reflection fraction is in agreement with the overall\ntrend built-in You et al. 2023 with a large sample of outbursts from other\nX-ray binaries. Hence Swift J1727.8--1613 turns out to be the first sample to\nbridge the MAXI J1820+070 to the majority of X-ray binaries according to the\ndual correlations observed between the spectral index and the reflection\nfraction.

    "abstract":"Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are crucial for quantum technologies such as\nquantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements.\nTwo-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE\ncandidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction.\nHowever, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing\ntelecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as\n\\defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital\nderived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing\nthese dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the\nlanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to\ninvestigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped\n\\defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with\nup to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate\nlattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results\nshow that while \\defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies\nenhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect\nstates introduced by \\defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain\nstable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows\nthat Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron\ndoping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds.\nThese states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo.\nConsequently, \\defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to\nits empty $f$-shell, whereas \\defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the\ninfrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as\ntunable SPEs and provide design strategies for optimizing their optical and\nelectronic properties.",

In this\npaper, we propose a novel point cloud compression and transmission framework\nfor resource-constrained robotic applications, called RCPCC. We iteratively fit\nthe surface of point clouds with a similar range value and eliminate redundancy\nthrough their spatial relationships.

Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of\n40$\\times$ to 80$\\times$ while maintaining high accuracy for downstream\napplications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of\naccuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70$\\times$.

    "abstract":"Active mode mismatch sensing and control can facilitate optimal coupling in\noptical cavity experiments such as interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors. In this paper, we demonstrate a radio-frequency (RF) beam wavefront\ncurvature modulation-based mode mismatch sensing scheme inspired by the\npreviously proposed RF beam jitter alignment sensing scheme. The proposed mode\nmismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is\ndesigned to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as\na mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and\ngenerates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully\ninvestigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation\nboth analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size\nevolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into\nconsideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of\nthe incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size, which along\nwith a ``trade-off'' consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal\nand the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile\nthat interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.",

    "abstract":"Human-multi-robot shared control leverages human decision-making and robotic\nautonomy to enhance human-robot collaboration. While widely studied, existing\nsystems often adopt a leader-follower model, limiting robot autonomy to some\nextent. Besides, a human is required to directly participate in the motion\ncontrol of robots through teleoperation, which significantly burdens the\noperator. To alleviate these two issues, we propose a layered shared control\ncomputing framework using human-influenced guiding vector fields (HI-GVF) for\nhuman-robot collaboration. HI-GVF guides the multi-robot system along a desired\npath specified by the human. Then, an intention field is designed to merge the\nhuman and robot intentions, accelerating the propagation of the human intention\nwithin the multi-robot system. Moreover, we give the stability analysis of the\nproposed model and use collision avoidance based on safety barrier certificates\nto fine-tune the velocity. Eventually, considering the firefighting task as an\nexample scenario, we conduct simulations and experiments using multiple\nhuman-robot interfaces (brain-computer interface, myoelectric wristband,\neye-tracking), and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach boosts\nthe effectiveness and performance of the task.",

This is primarily due to its distinct Raman signatures and the\ncapability of resolving its structure with high precision through diffraction\nmeasurements. These attributes enable a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthermodynamic quantities involved in this complex process, which are essential\nfor the physical description of the crystallization of glasses undergoing\nheterogeneous nucleation. We report on high-pressure in situ analyses of three\ncrystalline phases of PS: a stable monoclinic structure, a metastable hexagonal\nstructure, and a lower symmetry metastable phase. Combined high-pressure Raman\nand synchrotron X-ray diffraction indicate that the structures are highly\nsensitive to the application of hydrostatic pressure and that significant\nstructural rearrangements can be achieved in moderate pressure regimes. Such\nanalyses also enabled determining important thermodynamic variables of those\nsystems, such as compressibility. From an applied perspective, our findings\ndemonstrate that the application of pressure achievable using large-volume\npresses and capable of altering the energy states of such phases, can be\nregarded as a promising strategy to influence the stages of the overall\ncrystallization process.

    "abstract":"Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in\nimage- and region-level remote sensing (RS) image understanding tasks, such as\nimage captioning, visual question answering, and visual grounding. However,\nexisting RS MLLMs lack the pixel-level dialogue capability, which involves\nresponding to user instructions with segmentation masks for specific instances.\nIn this paper, we propose GeoPix, a RS MLLM that extends image understanding\ncapabilities to the pixel level. This is achieved by equipping the MLLM with a\nmask predictor, which transforms visual features from the vision encoder into\nmasks conditioned on the LLM's segmentation token embeddings. To facilitate the\nsegmentation of multi-scale objects in RS imagery, a class-wise learnable\nmemory module is integrated into the mask predictor to capture and store\nclass-wise geo-context at the instance level across the entire dataset. In\naddition, to address the absence of large-scale datasets for training\npixel-level RS MLLMs, we construct the GeoPixInstruct dataset, comprising\n65,463 images and 140,412 instances, with each instance annotated with text\ndescriptions, bounding boxes, and masks. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage\ntraining strategy to balance the distinct requirements of text generation and\nmasks prediction in multi-modal multi-task optimization. Extensive experiments\nverify the effectiveness and superiority of GeoPix in pixel-level segmentation\ntasks, while also maintaining competitive performance in image- and\nregion-level benchmarks.",

    "title":"The THESAN-ZOOM project: central starbursts and inside-out quenching\n  govern galaxy sizes in the early Universe",
    "abstract":"We explore the evolution of galaxy sizes at high redshift ($3 < z < 13$)\nusing the high-resolution THESAN-ZOOM radiation-hydrodynamics simulations,\nfocusing on the mass range of $10^6\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < \\mathrm{M}_{\\ast} <\n10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. Our analysis reveals that galaxy size growth is\ntightly coupled to bursty star formation. Galaxies above the star-forming main\nsequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by\ninside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to\nexpansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably,\nwe find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent\nwith observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute\nthis discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase\ninterstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective\nequation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also\nfind that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power\nlaw as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\\approx6$, because the\nmajority of galaxies at $z > 6$ show rising star-formation histories, and\ntherefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\\alpha$ emission is\nsystematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7,\nconsistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous\ninterpretations that link extended H$\\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we\nfind that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from\nH$\\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\\\"{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed\ntrends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the\nprimary driver of extended nebular emission.",

However, its complex spatial dependencies and\nnon-linear temporal dynamics can be challenging for traditional techniques.\nExisting methods tackle these challenges by learning the two dimensions\nseparately. Here, we introduce Temporal Graphormer (T-Graphormer), a\nTransformer-based approach capable of modelling spatiotemporal correlations\nsimultaneously. By incorporating temporal dynamics in the Graphormer\narchitecture, each node attends to all other nodes within the graph sequence.\nOur design enables the model to capture rich spatiotemporal patterns with\nminimal reliance on predefined spacetime inductive biases. We validate the\neffectiveness of T-Graphormer on real-world traffic prediction benchmark\ndatasets. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, T-Graphormer reduces root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by up to 10%.",

    "abstract":"Cold-atom magnetometers can achieve an exceptional combination of superior\nsensitivity and high spatial resolution. One key challenge these quantum\nsensors face is improving the sensitivity within a given timeframe while\npreserving a high dynamic range. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an\nadaptive entanglement-free cold-atom magnetometry with both superior\nsensitivity and high dynamic range. Employing a tailored adaptive Bayesian\nquantum estimation algorithm designed for Ramsey interferometry using coherent\npopulation trapping (CPT), cold-atom magnetometry facilitates adaptive\nhigh-precision detection of a direct-current (d.c.) magnetic field with high\ndynamic range. Through implementing a sequence of correlated CPT-Ramsey\ninterferometry, the sensitivity significantly surpasses the standard quantum\nlimit with respect to total interrogation time. We yield a sensitivity of\n6.8$\\pm$0.1 picotesla per square root of hertz over a range of 145.6 nanotesla,\nexceeding the conventional frequentist protocol by 3.3$\\pm$0.1 decibels.

    "abstract":"Binary classification is a task that involves the classification of data into\none of two distinct classes. It is widely utilized in various fields. However,\nconventional classifiers tend to make overconfident predictions for data that\nbelong to overlapping regions of the two class distributions or for data\noutside the distributions (out-of-distribution data). Therefore, conventional\nclassifiers should not be applied in high-risk fields where classification\nresults can have significant consequences. In order to address this issue, it\nis necessary to quantify uncertainty and adopt decision-making approaches that\ntake it into account. Many methods have been proposed for this purpose;\nhowever, implementing these methods often requires performing resampling,\nimproving the structure or performance of models, and optimizing the thresholds\nof classifiers. We propose a new decision-making approach using two types of\nhypothesis testing. This method is capable of detecting ambiguous data that\nbelong to the overlapping regions of two class distributions, as well as\nout-of-distribution data that are not included in the training data\ndistribution. In addition, we quantify uncertainty using the empirical\ndistribution of feature values derived from the training data obtained through\nthe trained model.

    "title":"Self-assembly of Dipolar Crystals from Magnetic Colloids",
    "abstract":"We study the self-assembly of magnetic colloids using the Stockmayer (SM)\nmodel characterized by short-range Lennard-Jones interactions and long-range\ndipole-dipole interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we design\ncooling protocols that yield perfectly assembled single-domain magnetic\ncrystals. We identify cooling rates at which the system transforms from an\namorphous glass to a crystal, where magnetic ordering promotes crystalline\norder. Remarkably, we observe that the latter develops via a spontaneous\ntransition rather than through the traditional nucleation and growth mechanism.\nFor a weakly dipolar fluid ($\\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a\nface-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along\nthe (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\\mu = 2.5$), the\ncrystal structure shifts towards a body-centered orthorhombic (BCO) arrangement\ndue to the compression of chains from strong dipolar attractions. These results\nprovide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving crystallization in\nmagnetic fluids, opening new avenues for understanding the formation of\nmagnetically responsive colloidal magnetic crystals with promising\napplications.",

    "abstract":"Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to locate an object of\ninterest in a captured ground- or drone-view image within the satellite image.\nHowever, existing works treat ground-view and drone-view query images\nequivalently, overlooking their inherent viewpoint discrepancies and the\nspatial correlation between the query image and the satellite-view reference\nimage. To this end, this paper proposes a novel View-specific Attention\nGeo-localization method (VAGeo) for accurate CVOGL. Specifically, VAGeo\ncontains two key modules: view-specific positional encoding (VSPE) module and\nchannel-spatial hybrid attention (CSHA) module. In object-level, according to\nthe characteristics of different viewpoints of ground and drone query images,\nviewpoint-specific positional codings are designed to more accurately identify\nthe click-point object of the query image in the VSPE module. In feature-level,\na hybrid attention in the CSHA module is introduced by combining channel\nattention and spatial attention mechanisms simultaneously for learning\ndiscriminative features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed VAGeo gains a significant performance improvement, i.e., improving\nacc@0.25\/acc@0.5 on the CVOGL dataset from 45.43%\/42.24% to 48.21%\/45.22% for\nground-view, and from 61.97%\/57.66% to 66.19%\/61.87% for drone-view.",

    "abstract":"Diffusion transformers(DiTs) struggle to generate images at resolutions\nhigher than their training resolutions. The primary obstacle is that the\nexplicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolation which\ndegrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In\nthis paper, we propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer(LEDiT), a\nsimple yet powerful architecture to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no\nexplicit PEs, thereby avoiding extrapolation. The key innovations of LEDiT are\nintroducing causal attention to implicitly impart global positional information\nto tokens, while enhancing locality to precisely distinguish adjacent tokens.\nExperiments on 256x256 and 512x512 ImageNet show that LEDiT can scale the\ninference resolution to 512x512 and 1024x1024, respectively, while achieving\nbetter image quality compared to current state-of-the-art length extrapolation\nmethods(NTK-aware, YaRN). Moreover, LEDiT achieves strong extrapolation\nperformance with just 100K steps of fine-tuning on a pretrained DiT,\ndemonstrating its potential for integration into existing text-to-image DiTs.\nProject page: https:\/\/shenzhang2145.github.io\/ledit\/",

    "abstract":"Observations have established that the masses of supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) correlate tightly with the stellar masses of their host galaxies,\nalbeit with substantial scatter. The size of this scatter as a function of\ngalaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of\nSMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this\nwork, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the\n$M_{\\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\\star}$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris,\nIllustrisTNG (TNG), and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that the\nscatter in TNG is significantly lower than in Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting\ntheir different BH feedback models. By performing various numerical\nexperiments, we quantify different contributions to the scatter in the\nsimulations, and also identify a suitably defined intrinsic scatter. The\nintrinsic scatter in Illustris and EAGLE is $\\sim0.3$ dex at $z=0$, and is\ndominated by variations from BH accretion, whereas the smaller scatter of TNG\nis rather dominated by hierarchical merging, suggesting that the massive\ngalaxies in TNG are more tightly quenched. Variations in the BH seed mass can\ncontribute to the scatter of the $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\star}$ relation as well, but\nwhether this still plays a role at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model.\nSimulations with disabled AGN feedback produce much higher scatter for low-mass\ngalaxies than seen in our cosmological simulations, demonstrating the crucial\ninfluence of feedback for determining the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host\ngalaxies in this regime. In contrast, an important factor in reducing the\nscatter for massive galaxies is hierarchical merging of mostly quenched\nsystems. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the\n$M_{\\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\\star}$ relation at high redshift could be particularly\npowerful in providing clues to the origin of SMBHs.",

    "abstract":"This chapter is about the fundamentals of fabrication, control, and\nhuman-robot interaction of a new type of collaborative robotic manipulators,\ncalled malleable robots, which are based on adjustable architectures of varying\nstiffness for achieving high dexterity with lower mobility arms. Collaborative\nrobots, or cobots, commonly integrate six or more degrees of freedom (DOF) in a\nserial arm in order to allow positioning in constrained spaces and adaptability\nacross tasks. Increasing the dexterity of robotic arms has been indeed\ntraditionally accomplished by increasing the number of degrees of freedom of\nthe system; however, once a robotic task has been established (e.g., a\npick-and-place operation), the motion of the end-effector can be normally\nachieved using less than 6-DOF (i.e., lower mobility). The aim of malleable\nrobots is to close the technological gap that separates current cobots from\nachieving flexible, accessible manufacturing automation with a reduced number\nof actuators.",

    "title":"Robust Palm-Vein Recognition Using the MMD Filter: Improving SIFT-Based\n  Feature Matching",
    "abstract":"A major challenge with palm vein images is that slight movements of the\nfingers and thumb, or variations in hand posture, can stretch the skin in\ndifferent areas and alter the vein patterns. This can result in an infinite\nnumber of variations in palm vein images for a given individual. This paper\nintroduces a novel filtering technique for SIFT-based feature matching, known\nas the Mean and Median Distance (MMD) Filter. This method evaluates the\ndifferences in keypoint coordinates and computes the mean and median in each\ndirection to eliminate incorrect matches. Experiments conducted on the 850nm\nsubset of the CASIA dataset indicate that the proposed MMD filter effectively\npreserves correct points while reducing false positives detected by other\nfiltering methods. A comparison with existing SIFT-based palm vein recognition\nsystems demonstrates that the proposed MMD filter delivers outstanding\nperformance, achieving lower Equal Error Rate (EER) values. This article\npresents an extended author's version based on our previous work, A Keypoint\nFiltering Method for SIFT based Palm-Vein Recognition.",

In this paper, to\nunderstand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities\nof existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the\ngenerated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for\ndifferent reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the\nability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first\nperform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the\neffectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct\nextensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic\nmodels to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to\ninvestigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models.\nFinally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand\nthe long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.",

    "abstract":"The temperature of the cold dust in z>6 galaxies is a potential tracer of\nActive Galactic Nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback, and is the dominant source\nof uncertainty in inferring properties from the far-infrared (FIR) emission of\nthese galaxies. We present the first resolved dust temperature map in a $z>6$\nquasar host galaxy. We combine new 360 pc resolution ALMA Band 9 continuum\nobservations with literature 190 pc Band 6 observations to derive the dust\ntemperature and opacity at 0.1<r<0.5 kpc scales in a $z=6.9$ luminous quasar\nhost galaxy (J2348-3054). We find that the dust temperature (and opacity)\nincreases at the center (r<216 pc) of the galaxy up to $T_d=73-88$ K, and\npotentially up to $T_d<149$ K at r<110 pc. The combination of the resolved and\nintegrated FIR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) further reveal a dust\ntemperature gradient and a significant contribution of the AGN hot dust torus\nat $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}}\\gtrsim 700$ GHz. By taking into account the torus\ncontribution and resolved optically-thick emission, we derive a total infrared\nluminosity ($L_{TIR}=8.78\\pm0.10)\\times 10^{12}L_\\odot$) and corresponding\nstar-formation rate (SFR$=1307\\pm15\\ M_\\odot\\ \\rm{yr}^{-1}$), that are at least\na factor $\\sim 3.6$ ($\\sim0.56$ dex) lower than previous measurements assuming\noptically-thin emission. We compare the resolved dust temperature, mass and IR\nluminosity profiles to simulations where they are only reproduced by models in\nwhich the AGN radiation heats the dust in the center of the galaxy. Our\nobservations provide evidence that dust in J2348--3054 cannot be assumed to be\nuniformly cold and optically thin.

    "abstract":"Hydrogel evaporative cooling has recently emerged as an appealing strategy\nfor personal cooling. However, with the increasing prevalence of extreme heat\nevents featuring high temperatures (above 40$^{\\circ}$C) and relative humidity\n(RH$> 30\\%$), hydrogel alone may not achieve thermal comfort under most\nconditions, as it must be maintained at a sufficiently high temperature-often\nexceeding the skin comfort temperature ($\\sim$35.8$^{\\circ}$C)-to achieve\neffective evaporation in hot, humid environments. This study integrates\nthermoelectric devices (TEDs) with hydrogels to create a personal cooling\nsolution suited to extreme heat. TEDs pump heat away from the skin, maintaining\nit at a comfortable temperature, while simultaneously raising the temperature\nof a hydrogel layer positioned on top of the TEDs to enhance its evaporation\nrate. The TED-hydrogel tandem device outperforms TEDs or hydrogel alone in\nextreme conditions (up to 55$^{\\circ}$C and RH$> 30\\%$). Furthermore, the\nactive temperature control enabled by the TEDs allows the system to adapt to\nvarying thermal loads and environmental conditions. With a manageable hydrogel\nand battery weight, this cooling system can operate for over six hours. These\nresults demonstrate the potential of hybrid evaporative and thermoelectric\ncooling as an efficient, adaptable, and sustainable personal cooling solution\nto combat extreme heat.",

Our results showed consistency with the expected results,\nvalidating our method for features and pattern recognition.

Students are\nrewarded using tokens, SmileyCoins or SMLY, as they progress through the system\nand the libraries are free to sell for SMLY small food items, sanitary pads and\neven the tablets themselves. The rewards are designed to put an emphasis on\nsecondary school mathematics, so as to prepare the students for applications\ninto STEM subjects at university. Completion of the corresponding collection of\ndrills gives SmileyCoin awards sufficient to purchase a tablet.",

The integration of RIS in satellite networks addresses\ncritical challenges such as limited spectrum resources and high path loss,\nmaking it an ideal candidate for next-generation Internet of Things (IoT)\nnetworks. This paper provides a new framework based on transmissive beyond\ndiagonal RIS (T-BD-RIS) mounted low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks with\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). The NOMA power allocation at LEO and\nphase shift design at T-BD-RIS are optimized to maximize the system's spectral\nefficiency. The optimization problem is formulated as non-convex, which is\nfirst transformed using successive convex approximation and then divided into\ntwo problems. A closed-form solution is obtained for LEO satellite transmit\npower using KKT conditions, and a semi-definite relaxation approach is adopted\nfor the T-BD-RIS phase shift design. Numerical results are obtained based on\nMonte Carlo simulations, which demonstrate the advantages of T-BD-RIS in\nsatellite networks.",

However, traditional computational methods can be\nresource-intensive due to the enormous sequence length encountered in practice.\nRecently, applied quantum algorithms have been anticipated to provide potential\nadvantages over classical approaches. In this paper, we propose a\npermutation-invariant variational quantum kernel method specifically designed\nfor DNA comparison. To represent the four nucleotide bases in DNA sequences\nwith quantum states, we introduce a novel, theoretically motivated encoding\nscheme: the four distinct bases are encoded using the states of symmetric,\ninformationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVMs). This\nencoding ensures mutual equality: each pair of symbols is equidistant on the\nBloch sphere. Also, since permutation invariance is inherent to common DNA\nsimilarity measures such as Levenshtein distance, we realize it by using a\nspecially designed parameterized quantum layer. We show that our novel encoding\nmethod and parameterized layers used in the quantum kernel model can\neffectively capture the symmetric characteristics of the pairwise DNA sequence\ncomparison task. We validate our model through numerical experiments, which\nyield promising results on length-$8$ DNA sequences.",

    "abstract":"Natural language video localization (NLVL) is a crucial task in video\nunderstanding that aims to localize the target moment in videos specified by a\ngiven language description. Recently, a point-supervised paradigm has been\npresented to address this task, requiring only a single annotated frame within\nthe target moment rather than complete temporal boundaries. Compared with the\nfully-supervised paradigm, it offers a balance between localization accuracy\nand annotation cost. However, due to the absence of complete annotation, it is\nchallenging to align the video content with language descriptions, consequently\nhindering accurate moment prediction. To address this problem, we propose a new\nCOllaborative Temporal consistEncy Learning (COTEL) framework that leverages\nthe synergy between saliency detection and moment localization to strengthen\nthe video-language alignment. Specifically, we first design a frame- and a\nsegment-level Temporal Consistency Learning (TCL) module that models semantic\nalignment across frame saliencies and sentence-moment pairs. Then, we design a\ncross-consistency guidance scheme, including a Frame-level Consistency Guidance\n(FCG) and a Segment-level Consistency Guidance (SCG), that enables the two\ntemporal consistency learning paths to reinforce each other mutually. Further,\nwe introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment Loss (HCAL) to\ncomprehensively align the video and text query. Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against SoTA\napproaches. We will release all the source codes.",

With the presence of a positive\ndamping term and nonnegative mass term, we derive $L^2-L^2$ decay estimates for\nthe solution of the homogeneous linear fractional damped wave equation on\n$\\mathbb{H}^{n}$, for its time derivative, and for its space derivatives. We\nalso discuss how these estimates can be improved when we consider additional\n$L^1$-regularity for the Cauchy data in the absence of the mass term. Also, in\nthe absence of mass term, we prove the global well-posedness for $2\\leq p\\leq\n1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{(\\mathcal{Q}-2\\alpha)_{+}}$ $(\\text{or\n}1+\\frac{4\\alpha}{\\mathcal{Q}}<p\\leq\n1+\\frac{2\\alpha}{(\\mathcal{Q}-2\\alpha)_{+}})$ in the case of $L^1\\cap L^2$\n$(\\text{or } L^2)$ Cauchy data, respectively. However, in the presence of the\nmass term, the global (in time) well-posedness for small data holds for $1<p\n\\leq 1+ \\frac{2\\alpha}{(\\mathcal{Q}-2\\alpha)_{+}}$. Finally, as an application\nof the linear decay estimates, we investigate well-posedness for the Cauchy\nproblem for a weakly coupled system with two semilinear fractional damped wave\nequations with positive mass term on $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$.",

    "abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across diverse\ntasks but often struggle to accurately gauge their knowledge boundaries,\nleading to confident yet incorrect responses. This paper explores leveraging\nLLMs' internal states to enhance their perception of knowledge boundaries from\nefficiency and risk perspectives. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate\ntheir confidence using internal states before response generation, potentially\nsaving computational resources. Our experiments on datasets like Natural\nQuestions, HotpotQA, and MMLU reveal that LLMs demonstrate significant\npre-generation perception, which is further refined post-generation, with\nperception gaps remaining stable across varying conditions. To mitigate risks\nin critical domains, we introduce Consistency-based Confidence Calibration\n($C^3$), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation.\n$C^3$ significantly improves LLMs' ability to recognize their knowledge gaps,\nenhancing the unknown perception rate by 5.6\\% on NQ and 4.9\\% on HotpotQA. Our\nfindings suggest that pre-generation confidence estimation can optimize\nefficiency, while $C^3$ effectively controls output risks, advancing the\nreliability of LLMs in practical applications.",

    "abstract":"Education technologies (edtech) are increasingly incorporating new features\nbuilt on large language models (LLMs), with the goals of enriching the\nprocesses of teaching and learning and ultimately improving learning outcomes.\nHowever, the potential downstream impacts of LLM-based edtech remain\nunderstudied. Prior attempts to map the risks of LLMs have not been tailored to\neducation specifically, even though it is a unique domain in many respects:\nfrom its population (students are often children, who can be especially\nimpacted by technology) to its goals (providing the correct answer may be less\nimportant for learners than understanding how to arrive at an answer) to its\nimplications for higher-order skills that generalize across contexts (e.g.,\ncritical thinking and collaboration). We conducted semi-structured interviews\nwith six edtech providers representing leaders in the K-12 space, as well as a\ndiverse group of 23 educators with varying levels of experience with LLM-based\nedtech. Through a thematic analysis, we explored how each group is\nanticipating, observing, and accounting for potential harms from LLMs in\neducation. We find that, while edtech providers focus primarily on mitigating\ntechnical harms, i.e., those that can be measured based solely on LLM outputs\nthemselves, educators are more concerned about harms that result from the\nbroader impacts of LLMs, i.e., those that require observation of interactions\nbetween students, educators, school systems, and edtech to measure. Overall, we\n(1) develop an education-specific overview of potential harms from LLMs, (2)\nhighlight gaps between conceptions of harm by edtech providers and those by\neducators, and (3) make recommendations to facilitate the centering of\neducators in the design and development of edtech tools.",

    "abstract":"The increasing traffic demand in cellular networks has recently led to the\ninvestigation of new strategies to save precious resources like spectrum and\nenergy. Direct device-to-device (D2D) communication becomes a promising\nsolution if the two terminals are located in close proximity. In this case, the\nD2D communications should coexist with cellular transmissions, so they must be\ncarefully scheduled in order to avoid harmful interference impacts. In this\npaper, we outline a novel framework encompassing channel allocation, mode\nselection and power control for D2D communications. Power allocation is done in\na distributed and cognitive fashion at the beginning of each time slot, based\non local information, while channel\/mode selection is performed in a\ncentralized manner only at the beginning of an epoch, a time interval including\na series of subsequent time slots. This hybrid approach guarantees an effective\ntradeoff between overhead and adaptivity. We analyze in depth the distributed\npower allocation mechanism, and we state a theorem which allows to derive the\noptimal power allocation strategy and to compute the corresponding throughput.\nExtensive simulations confirm the benefits granted by our approach, when\ncompared with state-of-the-art distributed schemes, in terms of throughput and\nfairness.",

    "abstract":"We investigate the formation of helical multifilament bundles and the torque\nrequired to achieve them as a function of applied twist. Hyperelastic filaments\nwith circular cross sections are mounted parallel in a uniform circle onto\nend-clamps that can move along the twist axis depending on the applied axial\nload. With increasing twist, the filaments describe a hyperbolic hyperboloid\nsurface before coming into contact in a circle, and then packing in a tight\nhelical bundle in the center with increasing twist. While the bundle appears\nordered for sufficiently small number of filaments, they are disordered for\nlarge enough number of filaments and applied twist. We reveal with x-ray\ntomography, that the packing of the filaments becomes disordered following a\nradial-instability which leads to a decrease in bundle radius, and migration of\nfilaments relative to each other in the bundle. Nonetheless, the helical angle\nof the filaments in the bundle are found to be essentially constant, resulting\nin inclination angles which increase with distance from axis of rotation. We\ndevelop energy minimization analysis to capture the observed variations in\nbundle length and torque as a function of number of filaments considering the\nneo-Hookean nature of the filaments. We show that the bundle geometry and the\napplied load can be used to describe the non-linear torque profile measured as\na function of twist angle.",

We show that the Hilbert-Schmidt\nspeed (HSS), a measure of non-Markovianity, serves as a reliable figure of\nmerit for evaluating the role of this correlation-based memory on the global\nmemory effects, for both unital and non-unital channels. The intensity of the\ncorrelation-based memory is ruled by a classical correlation strength between\nconsecutive applications of the channel. We demonstrate that, for unital noisy\nchannels, increasing the number of qubits of the system significantly weakens\nthe sensitivity of the HSS to this classical correlation strength. Such a\npattern indicates that the state evolution of large quantum systems may be less\nprone to be affected by classical correlations between noisy channels.\nMoreover, assuming the qubits are affected by independent or classically\ncorrelated local non-Markovian unital channels, we observe that, as the number\nof qubits increases, the collective behavior of the multiqubit system inhibits\nthe non-Markovian features of the overall system dynamics.",

We compared responses to MR-specific attacks,\nwhich exploit the unique characteristics of remote collaborative immersive\nenvironments, and traditional security attacks implemented in MR. Our findings\nindicate that users generally exhibit lower recognition rates for immersive\nattacks (e.g., spatial occlusion) compared to attacks inspired by traditional\nones (e.g., click redirection). Our results demonstrate a clear gap in user\nawareness and responses when collaborating remotely in MR environments.

Recent research on using LLMs to generate\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating\ndiagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures\nusing XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms\nsuch as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and\nhints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related\ndiagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We\naddress three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math\ndiagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG\nis an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what\nprompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate\nSVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of\nautomatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM\nprompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram\ngeneration. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based\nevaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline\nvariations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students\nand teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance\nproblem-solving and learning experiences.",

Additionally,\nthe full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental\nproperties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).\nThree-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet\nconditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities,\nchallenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of\nconfined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To\ninvestigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites,\nwe perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development\nof hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the\ninstabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of\nthe initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and\njet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe\nlow-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the\nparsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities.\nRecollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external\nmaterial, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core.\nThis is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are\nfirst triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in\nthe case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results\nprovide valuable insights into the complex processes governing AGN jets and\ncould be used to model the properties of low-power, weakly magnetized jetted\nAGNs.",

However, the efficiency of these methods\nmay suffer from repeated upsampling and decoding, while their reconstruction\nfidelity and quality are constrained by the intrinsic representational\nlimitations of coordinate-based functions. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel ContinuousSR framework with a Pixel-to-Gaussian paradigm, which\nexplicitly reconstructs 2D continuous HR signals from LR images using Gaussian\nSplatting. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming upsampling and\ndecoding, enabling extremely fast arbitrary-scale super-resolution. Once the\nGaussian field is built in a single pass, ContinuousSR can perform\narbitrary-scale rendering in just 1ms per scale. Our method introduces several\nkey innovations.

    "abstract":"Because of the continuous variations in mass, metallicity, and opacity, dwarf\nstars are distributed along the main sequence on optical and near-IR\ncolor-magnitude diagrams following a smooth polynomial. In this study of\nutilizing a catalog of cross-matched GALEX and Gaia sources, we identify two\ndistinct populations of M dwarfs in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band on the\n$M_{NUV}$ vs. $M_G$ diagram. We also reveal a pronounced increase in the number\nof stars exhibiting high NUV fluxes near the spectral type M2 or $M_G\\sim9.4$,\ncoinciding with the $H_2$ formation in the atmosphere to improve the energy\ntransportation at the surface. This suggests that certain yet-to-be-understood\nstellar mechanisms drive heightened activity in the NUV band around the\neffective temperature of M2 and later types of M dwarfs. Through examination of\narchival Hubble Space Telescope spectra, we show that Fe II line forests at\n$\\sim$2400A and 2800A dominate the spectral features in the GALEX NUV bandpass,\ncontributing to the observed excess fluxes at a given mass between the two\npopulations. Additionally, our investigation indicates that fast rotators and\nyoung stars likely increase brightness in the NUV band, but not all stars with\nbright NUV fluxes are fast rotators or young stars.",

We propose\nPreference Optimization for Combinatorial Optimization (POCO), a training\nparadigm that leverages solution preferences via objective values. It\nintroduces: (1) an efficient preference pair construction for better explore\nand exploit solutions, and (2) a novel loss function that adaptively scales\ngradients via objective differences, removing reliance on reward models or\nreference policies. Experiments on Job-Shop Scheduling (JSP), Traveling\nSalesman (TSP), and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (FJSP) show POCO outperforms\nstate-of-the-art neural methods, reducing optimality gaps impressively with\nefficient inference. POCO is architecture-agnostic, enabling seamless\nintegration with existing NCO models, and establishes preference optimization\nas a principled framework for combinatorial optimization.",

    "abstract":"Despite Greece's pivotal role in the global economy, large language models\n(LLMs) remain underexplored for Greek financial context due to the linguistic\ncomplexity of Greek and the scarcity of domain-specific datasets. Previous\nefforts in multilingual financial natural language processing (NLP) have\nexposed considerable performance disparities, yet no dedicated Greek financial\nbenchmarks or Greek-specific financial LLMs have been developed until now. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Plutus-ben, the first Greek Financial Evaluation\nBenchmark, and Plutus-8B, the pioneering Greek Financial LLM, fine-tuned with\nGreek domain-specific data. Plutus-ben addresses five core financial NLP tasks\nin Greek: numeric and textual named entity recognition, question answering,\nabstractive summarization, and topic classification, thereby facilitating\nsystematic and reproducible LLM assessments. To underpin these tasks, we\npresent three novel, high-quality Greek financial datasets, thoroughly\nannotated by expert native Greek speakers, augmented by two existing resources.\nOur comprehensive evaluation of 22 LLMs on Plutus-ben reveals that Greek\nfinancial NLP remains challenging due to linguistic complexity, domain-specific\nterminology, and financial reasoning gaps. These findings underscore the\nlimitations of cross-lingual transfer, the necessity for financial expertise in\nGreek-trained models, and the challenges of adapting financial LLMs to Greek\ntext.

Besides the plateau with dynamical exponent\n$z=1.388$ near the transition point, there is a second one with $z=1$ away from\nthe transition point. Then we demonstrate that these two plateaus intrinsically\naffect the critical dynamics with moderate quench rate by employing both\none-way and round-trip quench protocols. In the one-way quench protocol, we\nclarify that the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) regime consists of two sub-regimes with\ndifferent KZ exponents, which is a direct consequence of the two-plateau\nstructure of the dynamical exponent. We also diagnose the KZ, pre-saturated,\nand saturated regimes by varying the quench rate from slow to fast limits.\nWhile, in the round-trip quench protocol, we confirm the interference effect of\ntwo critical dynamics and show a narrow neck in the oscillatory density of\ndefects. It turns out that the position of the neck depends on the ratio of\nto-and-fro quench rates and the p-wave superconductivity pairing amplitude.

    "abstract":"We investigate the pseudospectrum of a Schwarzschild-like spacetime within\nthe framework of black hole perturbation theory to analyze a counterintuitive\nassertion regarding the instability of quasinormal modes. Recent findings\nsuggest that random perturbations to the effective potential associated with\ngravitational waves may enhance the stability of the underlying wave operator,\nthereby yielding a stable spectrum of randomly displaced quasinormal modes.\nGiven the unphysical nature of such random perturbations, this work examines\nthese findings within a spacetime that inherently exhibits a perturbed\nquasinormal spectrum. We find that, in contrast to the QNM spectrum of the\nSchwarzschild spacetime under random perturbations, the quasinormal spectrum of\na Schwarzschild-like black hole deformed through a physically motivated\nimplementation of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametrization is unstable. In\nparticular, we show that the pseudospectra of these Schwarzschild-like black\nholes do not display the typical features associated with wave operators that\nyield stable quasinormal spectra. We corroborate our findings by computing the\nquasinormal spectra when additional (ad-hoc) deformations are added to the\neffective potential of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko black hole. We also argue that\nwhen multiple perturbation sources are present, identifying the origin of the\ninstability may be difficult.",

    "abstract":"The mechanisms of Ly$\\alpha$ photon escape are key to understanding galaxy\nevolution and cosmic reionization, yet remain poorly understood. We investigate\nthe UV-continuum sizes of 23 Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at Cosmic Noon ($1.7 <\nz < 3.3$), extending previous size analyses to include fainter galaxies\n($M_{\\rm UV} \\simeq -14$) using gravitational lensing. Our results show that\nthese LAEs are unusually small for their luminosity, with a mean effective\nradius ($r_{\\rm eff}$) of $170 \\pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct\nsize-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\\rm UV} = -21$ approximately\nthree times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar\nredshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift\nGreen Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across\nredshifts. We also find that Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\\alpha$))\nincreases with decreasing $r_{\\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The\nsmall sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\\Sigma$SFR\n$= 1-600 M_{\\sun} \\ \\rm{yr}^{-1} \\ \\rm{kpc^{-2}}$), clearly separating them\nfrom typical SFGs in the $\\Sigma$SFR vs. $r_{\\rm eff}$ space. Given that high\n$\\Sigma$SFR is linked to strong galactic outflows, our findings imply that\ncompact morphology plays a key role in Ly$\\alpha$ escape, likely facilitated by\noutflows that clear under-dense channels in the ISM. Thus, these results\ndemonstrate that compact size and high $\\Sigma$SFR can help identify\nLy$\\alpha$-emitters.",

    "abstract":"The distinction of the stellar content in globular clusters (GCs) in multiple\nstellar populations characterized by different amounts of proton-capture\nelements has been well assessed since a long time. On the other hand, the\nexistence of noticeable variations in metallicity among GC stars is still\ndebated. In particular, recent spectroscopic analyses claimed the presence of a\nsmall variation in metallicity, ~0.1 dex, for the first generation (FG) stars\nin NGC 3201 and NGC 104. However, in both cases the claim is not robust because\nof the internal error of 0.1 dex associated to the [Fe\/H] values. To verify the\nreality of a metallicity variation we compared the two analyses, performed by\nthe same authors with identical methodology. We found trends of metallicity as\na function of the spectroscopically derived effective temperatures. However\nthey are in opposite directions; in NGC 3201 cooler (and brighter) stars have\nhigher [Fe\/H] values, whereas in 47 Tuc they show lower metallicities. The\ntrend is not statistically significant in the former case, but it is in the\nlatter. The dependence of metallicity on the luminosity along the red giant\nbranch seems to indicate problems in the abundance analysis for 47 Tuc.\nFinally, effective temperature do not show a significant variation as a\nfunction of the color spread along the HST pseudo-colour map, which we should\ninstead observe were the trends temperature-metallicity a real effects of\nintrinsic scatter in iron. According to this comparison, we conclude that with\nthese analyses, and the associated spurious trends, the issue of metallicity\nvariations in FG stars is hardly settled.",

    "abstract":"The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm uses large language models (LLMs) for automated\ntext evaluation, where a numerical assessment is assigned by an LLM to the\ninput text following scoring rubrics. Existing methods for LLM-as-a-judge use\ncross-entropy (CE) loss for fine-tuning, which neglects the numeric nature of\nscore prediction. Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM\nfine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning, which, however, does not\nconsider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper,\nwe introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), a method\ncombining CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT consists of two\nstages: first, seed LLM is fine-tuned to generate CoTs, which serve as\nsupervision for the second stage fine-tuning. The training objective of TRACT\ncombines the CE loss for learning the CoT reasoning capabilities, and the\nregression-aware loss for the score prediction.

    "abstract":"Image tokenizers form the foundation of modern text-to-image generative\nmodels but are notoriously difficult to train. Furthermore, most existing\ntext-to-image models rely on large-scale, high-quality private datasets, making\nthem challenging to replicate. In this work, we introduce Text-Aware\nTransformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TA-TiTok), an efficient and powerful\nimage tokenizer that can utilize either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional\ntokens. TA-TiTok uniquely integrates textual information during the tokenizer\ndecoding stage (i.e., de-tokenization), accelerating convergence and enhancing\nperformance. TA-TiTok also benefits from a simplified, yet effective, one-stage\ntraining process, eliminating the need for the complex two-stage distillation\nused in previous 1-dimensional tokenizers. This design allows for seamless\nscalability to large datasets. Building on this, we introduce a family of\ntext-to-image Masked Generative Models (MaskGen), trained exclusively on open\ndata while achieving comparable performance to models trained on private data.\nWe aim to release both the efficient, strong TA-TiTok tokenizers and the\nopen-data, open-weight MaskGen models to promote broader access and democratize\nthe field of text-to-image masked generative models.",

    "abstract":"Orbital entropies, pair entropies, and mutual information have become popular\ntools for analysis of strongly correlated wave functions. They can\nquantitatively measure how strongly an orbital (e.g. from the DMRG active\nspace) participates in the strong correlation and reveal the entanglement\npattern between different orbitals. However, this pattern can become rather\ncomplicated and sometimes difficult to interpret for large active spaces and is\nnot invariant with respect to the spin projection ($M_s$) component of the spin\nmultiplet state. We introduce a modified spin-free orbital entropy, pair\nentropy, and mutual information, which simplify the entanglement analysis and\nare invariant with respect to $M_s$. By comparison of these quantities with\ntheir ``original'' spin-including counterparts one can distinguish static\ncorrelation due to spin couplings from the ``genuine'' strong correlation due\nto a multiconfigurational character of the wave function. We illustrate the\napproach on a model consisting of a non-interacting dimer of triplet diradicals\nand on a more realistic example of iron-sulfur bound complexes with one and two\niron atoms.",

    "abstract":"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at fine-grained spatial\nresolution, offering insights into tissue molecular landscapes. Previous\nmethods for spatial gene expression prediction usually crop spots of interest\nfrom pathology tissue slide images, and learn a model that maps each spot to a\nsingle gene expression profile. However, it fundamentally loses spatial\nresolution of gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with\ndistinct gene expression; 2) spots are cropped at fixed resolutions, limiting\nthe ability to predict gene expression at varying spatial scales. To address\nthese limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network\ncapable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of\nvarying sizes and scales directly from pathology images. Different from\nprevious methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we\ngenerate a dense continuous gene expression map from the pathology image, and\naggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our\nPixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3 common ST datasets, while\nshowing superior performance in predicting gene expression across multiple\nspatial scales.

    "abstract":"In-context learning (ICL) has shown promising improvement in downstream task\nadaptation of LLMs by augmenting prompts with relevant input-output examples\n(demonstrations). However, the ICL demonstrations can contain privacy-sensitive\ninformation, which can be leaked and\/or regurgitated by the LLM output.\nDifferential Privacy (DP), a widely adopted privacy safeguard, has emerged to\nmitigate this privacy leakage, with recent work demonstrating strong\nprivacy-utility tradeoffs in classification tasks for ICL. However, generation\ntasks for ICL are challenging due to the high-dimensional output space of\nopen-ended generation. To this end, we propose $\\texttt{dps-mozo}$,\nDifferentially Private Sampling by Mixing One-shot with Zero-shot Outputs, a\ndecoding framework that generates DP text by sampling from the product of\nmultiple one-shot outputs mixed with a zero-shot output. This mixing\neffectively reduces the amount of information that can be leaked by each\ndemonstration. By utilizing the inherent randomness in sampling from the mixed\ndistributions, we can achieve DP without adding noise, thereby improving the\nprivacy-utility tradeoff. Our experimental evaluations show $\\texttt{dps-mozo}$\ncan achieve a strong privacy guarantee, $\\epsilon=2$, with minimal utility\ndegradation compared to non-private few-shot learning, $\\textbf{0.3}$% ROUGE-L\nF1 score decrease on the SAMSum dataset with Gemma 2 2B.",

For each PyPI library, we retrieve assigned URLs,\ndependencies, and, when available, owner type and GitHub donation links. Using\nPageRank, we analyze different subsets of libraries from both a library and\ndependency chain perspective. Our findings reveal that donation platform links\nare often omitted from PyPI project pages and instead listed on GitHub\nrepositories. GitHub Sponsors is the dominant platform, though many PyPI-listed\nlinks are outdated, emphasizing the need for automated link verification.\nAdoption rates vary significantly across libraries and dependency chains: while\nindividual PyPI libraries show low adoption, those used as dependencies have\nmuch higher usage.

    "title":"Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection\n  with Artifact Explanation",
    "abstract":"With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content\n(AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in\neveryday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection.\nDespite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity\nand locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and\ndo not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed\nfor both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only\nexcels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural\nlanguage explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability.\nAdditionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over\n100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact\nclues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to\nexpert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it\na robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across\nmultiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity\nclassification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for\nsynthetic image detection. The dataset and code will be released in:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/opendatalab\/FakeVLM.",

    "abstract":"Up until now the works regarding leptogenesis have discussed different\nmechanisms to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The\ntype-$II$ seesaw mechanism employing triplet scalars has been well studied in\nthis context and the triplet vacuum expectation value (VEV) answering to the\nobserved BAU is $(< 10^{-2} ~ GeV)$. On the contrary we are invoking an\nextended Georgi-Machacek type scenario, capable of generating BAU through\nleptogenesis while keeping the triplet VEV at a moderate range where it plays a\nnontrivial role in electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). In this study we have\nalso considered the decaying scalar mass responsible for leptogenesis to be\nwithin a TeV and hence one can probe this possibility at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) itself via different kinds of signature corresponding to\ndifferent triplet VEV region.",

    "abstract":"Inter-app communication is a mandatory and security-critical functionality of\noperating systems, such as Android. On the application level, Android\nimplements this facility through Intents, which can also transfer non-primitive\nobjects using Java's Serializable API. However, the Serializable API has a long\nhistory of deserialization vulnerabilities, specifically deserialization gadget\nchains. Research endeavors have been heavily directed towards the detection of\ndeserialization gadget chains on the Java platform. Yet, there is little\nknowledge about the existence of gadget chains within the Android platform. We\naim to close this gap by searching gadget chains in the Android SDK, Android's\nofficial development libraries, as well as frequently used third-party\nlibraries. To handle this large dataset, we design a gadget chain detection\ntool optimized for soundness and efficiency. In a benchmark on the full\nYsoserial dataset, it achieves similarly sound results to the state-of-the-art\nin significantly less time. Using our tool, we first show that the Android SDK\ncontains almost the same trampoline gadgets as the Java Class Library. We also\nfind that one can trigger Java native serialization through Android's Parcel\nAPI. Yet, running our tool on the Android SDK and 1,200 Android dependencies,\nin combination with a comprehensive sink dataset, yields no security-critical\ngadget chains. This result opposes the general notion of Java deserialization\ngadget chains being a widespread problem. Instead, the issue appears to be more\nnuanced, and we provide a perspective on where to direct further research.",

    "abstract":"A typical points-to analysis such as Andersen's or Steensgaard's may lose\nprecision because it ignores the branching structure of the analyzed program.\nMoreover, points-to analysis typically focuses on objects only, not considering\ninstructions manipulating primitive values. We argue that such an approach\nleads to an unnecessary precision loss, for example, when primitive constants\ntrue and false flow out of method calls. We propose a novel lightweight\npoints-to analysis called SkipFlow that interprocedurally tracks the flow of\nboth primitives and objects, and explicitly captures the branching structure of\nthe code using predicate edges. At the same time, however, SkipFlow is as\nlightweight and scalable as possible, unlike a traditional flow-sensitive\nanalysis. We apply SkipFlow to GraalVM Native Image, a closed-world solution to\nbuilding standalone binaries for Java applications. We evaluate the\nimplementation using a set of microservice applications as well as well-known\nbenchmark suites. We show that SkipFlow reduces the size of the application in\nterms of reachable methods by 9% on average without significantly increasing\nthe analysis time.",

    "title":"Alternative writings of classical elastodynamics equations as a first\n  order symmetric system",
    "abstract":"We explore alternative writings of the equations of classical elastodynamics\nas a first order symmetric system. In the one dimensional case we present\nsymmetric writings with respect to: i) the velocity ($u_t$) and the\ndisplacement gradient ($u_x$), ii) the velocity and stress ($\\sigma$), iii) all\nthree quantities: the velocity, the displacement gradient and the stress, and\nfinally iv) the momentum ($\\rho_0 u_t$), the velocity, the displacement\ngradient and the stress. In the two dimensional case we present similar\nwritings with respect to: i) the velocity (${\\bf u}_t$) and the strain tensor\n($\\bf e$), ii) the velocity and the stress tensor ($\\boldsymbol \\sigma$), iii)\nall three variables $({\\bf u}_t, {\\bf e}, \\boldsymbol \\sigma)$, and finally iv)\none more writing utilizing the momentum as well, i.e. $(\\rho_0 {\\bf u}_t, {\\bf\nu}_t, {\\bf e}, \\boldsymbol \\sigma)$. We accomplish our goal by judiciously\nusing the compatibility equations as well as the momentum equation and the time\ndifferentiated constitutive law. This is done in an inverse way: we start by\nwriting our initial equations as a first order system of the form ($\\bf q$\nbeing the vector representing the variables in each writing) $$\n  A \\frac{\\partial {\\bf q}}{\\partial t}+\\sum_{i=1}^n B_i \\frac{\\partial {\\bf\nq}}{\\partial x_i}=0, $$ with $n=1, 2$ depending on whether we are in 1 or 2\ndimensions. We then check what are the symmetric forms of matrices $B_i$ and\nwhich combinations of the compatibility equations, the momentum equations and\nthe time differentiated constitutive law should be used in order the symmetric\nform of matrices $B_i$ to appear into the system. This \"symmetrization\" process\nalters matrix $A$ and if the resulting matrix $A$ is symmetric our goal is\naccomplished. Our analysis is confined to classical elastodynamics, namely\ngeometrically and materially linear anisotropic elasticity.",

    "title":"The emission geometry of pulsars with interpulses",
    "abstract":"We present polarization profiles of 23 pulsars exhibiting interpulse (IP)\nemissions using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope\n(FAST). By applying the rotating vector model (RVM), we measured the\ninclination and impact angles for 16 pulsars, allowing us to investigate their\nbeam geometries. Our analysis indicates that for 5 pulsars, the IP emissions\nlikely originate from the same magnetic pole as the main pulse (MP), whereas\nfor the remaining 11 pulsars, the IP and MP emissions originate from opposite\nmagnetic poles. For the 7 pulsars that do not conform to the RVM, we are unable\nto determine whether the IP emissions originate from the same or opposite\nmagnetic pole as the MPs. By analyzing the beam configurations of pulsars, we\nfound that the emission within the beam is not fully active across both\nlongitude and latitude. Filling factors ranging from 0.27 to 0.99 were obtained\nfor pulsars with opposite pole IP emissions, suggesting an underestimation of\nemission height when applying the geometrical method. The emissions for MPs and\nIPs occur at different heights in the pulsar magnetosphere, with the difference\nin emission height ranging from tens to thousands of kilometers. We also found\nthat some pulsars have wide emission beams, indicating that radio emissions may\noccur in regions of high altitude within the pulsar magnetosphere.",

    "abstract":"Rural and urban areas exhibit distinct mobility patterns, yet a systematic\nunderstanding of how these trends differ across regions and contexts remains\nunderexplored. By using origin-destination matrices from Location-Based\nServices data in Colombia, India, and Mexico, we delineate urban and rural\nboundaries through network percolation, reducing reliance on conventional\nurbanisation metrics tied to the built environment. We gauge mobility dynamics\nacross regions developing a measure for routing inefficiency, which measures\nhow much longer empirical trips are than their optimal shortest path. Our\nfindings reveal that rural areas experience greater inefficiencies,\nparticularly for longer trips made later in the day. At the urban level, we\ndetermine the misalignment between urban mobility efficiency and public transit\naccessibility, by measuring the difference between their respective vector\nfields. We observe that most cities experience misalignment during regular\ncommuting hours, with Colombian cities exhibiting particularly high alignment.\nMeanwhile, mobility inefficiency in rural areas are associated with their\norientation around their most proximate city. City-level analyses uncover\ndisparities in the functions of rural and urban areas, with significant\nvariations between weekdays and weekends, reflecting distinct roles in\ncommuting and access to services. These findings highlight the importance of\ntailored, context-sensitive approaches to improving connectivity and reducing\ndisparities. This study offers new insights into the spatial and temporal\ndynamics of mobility inefficiency, contributing to equitable regional planning\nand sustainable mobility solutions.",

    "abstract":"The Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) problem, where an analyst interacts with a\ndataset through statistical queries, is often studied under the assumption of\nadversarial analyst behavior. To decrease this gap, we propose a revised model\nof ADA that accounts for more constructive interactions between the analysts\nand the data, where the goal is to enhance inference accuracy. Specifically, we\nfocus on distribution estimation as a central objective guiding analyst's\nqueries. The problem is addressed within a non-parametric Bayesian framework,\ncapturing the flexibility and dynamic evolution of analyst's beliefs. Our\nhierarchical approach leverages P\\'olya trees (PTs) as priors over the\ndistribution space, facilitating the adaptive selection of counting queries to\nefficiently reduce the estimation error without increasing the number of\nqueries. Furthermore, with its interpretability and conjugacy, the proposed\nframework allows for intuitive conversion of subjective beliefs into objective\npriors and their effortless updates to posteriors. Using theoretical\nderivations, we formalize the PT-based solution as a computational algorithm.\nSimulations further demonstrate its effectiveness in distribution estimation\ntasks compared to the non-adaptive approach. By aligning with real-world\napplications, this structured ADA framework fosters opportunities for\ncollaborative research in related areas, such as human-in-the-loop systems and\ncognitive studies of belief updating.",

    "abstract":"This work presents a detailed description of the thermochemical\nnon-equilibrium dissociation of diatomic molecules, and applies this theory to\nthe case of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation. The master equations are used to derive\ncorresponding aggregate rate constant expressions that hold for any degree of\nthermochemical non-equilibrium. These general expressions are analyzed in three\nkey limits\/ regimes: the thermal equilibrium limit, the quasi-steady-state\n(QSS) regime, and the pre-QSS regime. Under several simplifying assumptions, an\nanalytical source term expression that holds in all of these regimes, and is\nonly a function of the translational temperature, $T_{\\rm t}$, and the fraction\nof dissociation, $\\phi_{\\rm A}$, is proposed. This expression has two input\nparameters: the QSS dissociation rate constant in the absence of recombination,\n$k_{\\rm d,nr}(T_{\\rm t})$, and a pre-QSS correction factor, $\\eta(T_{\\rm t})$.\nThe value of $\\eta(T_{\\rm t})$ is evaluated by comparing the predictions of the\nproposed expression against existing master equation simulations of a 0-D\nisothermal and isochoric reactor for the case of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation with\nthe third-bodies $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm H$, and $\\rm He$. Despite its simple\nfunctional form, the proposed expression is able to reproduce the master\nequation results for the majority of the tested conditions. The best fit of\n$k_{\\rm d,nr}(T_{\\rm t})$ is then evaluated by conducting a detailed literature\nreview. Data from a wide range of experimental and computational studies are\nconsidered for the third-bodies $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm H$, and inert gases, and fits\nthat are valid from 200 to 20,000 K are proposed.

Conventional\nreconstruction algorithms require substantial overlap, increasing data volume\nand experimental time. We propose a reconstruction method employing a\nphysics-guided score-based diffusion model. Our approach trains a diffusion\nmodel on representative object images to learn an object distribution prior.\nDuring reconstruction, we modify the reverse diffusion process to enforce data\nconsistency, guiding reverse diffusion toward a physically plausible solution.\nThis method requires a single pretraining phase, allowing it to generalize\nacross varying scan overlap ratios and positions. Our results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method achieves high-fidelity reconstructions with only a 20%\noverlap, while the widely employed rPIE method requires a 62% overlap to\nachieve similar accuracy. This represents a significant reduction in data\nrequirements, offering an alternative to conventional techniques.",

In this work, we show that voter turnouts contain crucial information\nthat can be leveraged to predict several key electoral statistics with\nremarkable accuracy. Using the recently proposed random voting model, we\nanalytically derive the scaled distributions of votes secured by winners,\nrunner-ups, and margins of victory, and demonstrating their strong correlation\nwith turnout distributions. By analyzing Indian election data -- spanning\nmultiple decades and electoral scales -- we validate these predictions\nempirically across all scales, from large parliamentary constituencies to\npolling booths. Further, we uncover a surprising scale-invariant behavior in\nthe distributions of scaled margins of victory, a characteristic signature of\nIndian elections.

This work aims to provide a direct correlation\nbetween the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD\naccretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic\ncenter. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct\ncounter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux\ntubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux\ntubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by\nthe accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots,\nformed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they\ntravel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light.\nResults. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance\nout the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk\nand demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with\nthe NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor\nface-on inclinations in the range $[0^\\circ, 34^\\circ]$ and $[163^\\circ,\n180^\\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise\nnaturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for\nreproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.",

To address this, we redefine the task as a\ntwo-stage process.

In the second stage, we employ a diffusion model to synthesize video\nframes, incorporating the hand poses generated in the first stage to produce\nrealistic facial expressions and body movements. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,\nsuch as CyberHost and Vlogger, in terms of both visual quality and\nsynchronization accuracy.

    "abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, posing challenges for\ntheir safe deployment. Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive\nunderstanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To\naddress these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically\nevaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models\nand identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general\nneurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of\ngeneral neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to\nhierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an\ninterpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based\nstrategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs\ndemonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving\nthe model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and\nediting approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed\nanalysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender\nbias in LLMs.",

We examine UV-upturn galaxies within the semi-analytic model\nGABE, which embeds the formation of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars --\nproposed as key candidates responsible for the UV-upturn phenomenon. We have\nanalyzed all related physical processes, including stellar evolution, initial\nmass functions (IMFs), dust attenuation, galaxy age, metallicity, and binary\nfractions, in an effort to determine which processes play significant roles.\nOur findings reveal two categories of UV-upturn galaxies in the semi-analytic\nmodel, each with distinct formation channels: old metal-rich quenched\nelliptical galaxies, which are intrinsic UV-upturn galaxies induced by EHB\nstars within their old stellar populations, and dusty star-forming galaxies,\nwhich are relatively young and may also be photometrically identified as\nUV-upturn galaxies when accounting for dust attenuation. Dust attenuation\ncontributes to 20%-60% of the UV-upturn galaxies, depending on the specific\ndust attenuation models adopted. With the binary star formation model of EHB\nstars, both of these formation channels exhibit strong preferences for high\nstellar metallicity.

    "abstract":"Despite a decade's worth of gravitational wave observation, the origin of the\nbinary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO-VIRGO-Kagra (LVK)\ncollaboration remains an open question. Towards assessing the feasibility and\nprevalence of the many proposed BBH formation channels, the spin properties of\nthe merging black holes (BHs) hold significant promise, particularly their\norientations. The combined trends of a moderate preferential alignment of BH\nspins with their orbit normals and an apparent correlation of BBH effective\nspin parameters $\\chi_{\\rm eff}$ with their mass ratios seem to favor\nhydrodynamical BBH formation mechanisms over purely dynamical ones, as they\nintroduce a preferred orientation to the system. However, such processes are\nfilled with physical and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we highlight a\ndynamical route to easily characterizable spin evolution that results in\nanalytically-predictable spin distributions. We show that, when a stellar\nbinary forms a BBH through two phases of stable mass transfer, and the BBH is\nsubsequently driven to merger by the gravitational perturbation of a distant\nmassive object (such as a supermassive black hole), the resulting spin-orbit\nmisalignment angles are anti-correlated with the binary mass ratio. While the\nmechanism as proposed only operates in a somewhat narrow region of parameter\nspace, it also predicts significantly tighter correlations than are seen in the\nLVK systems. We discuss avenues for future work that may significantly expand\nthe parameter space of our mechanism while still remaining broadly consistent\nwith observations.",

    "abstract":"Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the standard in accelerating\nscientific applications on heterogeneous systems. However, as GPUs are getting\nfaster, one potential performance bottleneck with GPU-accelerated applications\nis the overhead from launching several fine-grained kernels. CUDA Graph\naddresses these performance challenges by enabling a graph-based execution\nmodel that captures operations as nodes and dependence as edges in a static\ngraph. Thereby consolidating several kernel launches into one graph launch. We\npropose a performance optimization strategy for iteratively launched kernels.\nBy grouping kernel launches into iteration batches and then unrolling these\nbatches into a CUDA Graph, iterative applications can benefit from CUDA Graph\nfor performance boosting. We analyze the performance gain and overhead from\nthis approach by designing a skeleton application. The skeleton application\nalso serves as a generalized example of converting an iterative solver to CUDA\nGraph, and for deriving a performance model. Using the skeleton application, we\nshow that when unrolling iteration batches for a given platform, there is an\noptimal size of the iteration batch, which is independent of workload,\nbalancing the extra overhead from graph creation with the performance gain of\nthe graph execution. Depending on workload, we show that the optimal iteration\nbatch size gives more than 1.4x speed-up in the skeleton application.\nFurthermore, we show that similar speed-up can be gained in Hotspot and\nHotspot3D from the Rodinia benchmark suite and a Finite-Difference Time-Domain\n(FDTD) Maxwell solver.",

This paper\nproposes a novel 3D Gaussian point distribution method for dynamic street scene\nreconstruction.

    "abstract":"We derive the mathematical condition under which the physical solution of the\nmany-electron problem, obtained by self-consistent approaches, becomes unstable\nupon increasing interaction strength. The validity of our criterion is\nexplicitly verified by performing self-consistent calculations of basic\ninteracting models. In this context, we eventually unveiled the precise\nconnection linking the misleading convergence of self-consistent schemes to the\nmultivaluedness of the Luttinger-Ward functional as well as to the divergences\nof the irreducible vertex function. Our analysis also explains how a misleading\nconvergence of self-consistent approximations can occur even in parameter\nregions without vertex divergences. Even more importantly, it allows us to\ndefine a general procedure for stabilizing the physical solution, when it is\nunstable in conventional self-consistent schemes.",

    "abstract":"Microservices have been a key architectural approach for over a decade,\ntransforming system design by promoting decentralization and allowing\ndevelopment teams to work independently on specific microservices. While\nloosely coupled microservices are ideal, dependencies between them are\ninevitable. Often, these dependencies go unnoticed by development teams.\nAlthough syntactic dependencies can be identified, tracking semantic\ndependencies - when multiple microservices share similar logic - poses a\ngreater challenge. As systems evolve, changes made to one microservice can\ntrigger ripple effects, jeopardizing system consistency and requiring updates\nto dependent services, which increases maintenance and operational complexity.\nEffectively tracking different types of dependencies across microservices is\nessential for anticipating the impact of such changes. This paper introduces\nthe Semantic Dependency Matrix as an instrument to address these challenges\nfrom a semantic perspective. We propose an automated approach to extract and\nrepresent these dependencies and demonstrate its effectiveness through a case\nstudy. This paper takes a step further by demonstrating the significance of\nsemantic dependencies, even in cases where there are no direct dependencies\nbetween microservices. It shows that these hidden dependencies can exist\nindependently of endpoint or data dependencies, revealing critical connections\nthat might otherwise be overlooked.",

Using supersymmetric localization, these\nfunctions can be expressed as matrix integrals which, in the planar limit,\nreduce to Fredholm determinants of certain semi-infinite matrices. This\npowerful representation allows us to investigate the correlation functions\nacross the parameter space of the quiver theory, including both weak and strong\ncoupling regimes and various limits of the number of nodes and the operator\nscaling dimensions. At strong coupling, the standard semiclassical AdS\/CFT\nexpansion diverges in the long quiver limit. However, by incorporating both\nperturbative corrections (in negative powers of the 't Hooft coupling) and an\ninfinite tower of nonperturbative, exponentially suppressed contributions, we\nderive a remarkably simple expression for the correlation functions in this\nlimit. These functions exhibit exponential decay with increasing node\nseparation and admit an interpretation within a five-dimensional effective\ntheory.

When there are two distinct Fermi seas, as\nis the case in WSe$_2$, there are two flavors of lowest-energy (attractive)\npolarons -- singlet and triplet -- where the exciton is coupled to the Fermi\nsea in the same or opposite valley, respectively. Using two-dimensional\ncoherent electronic spectroscopy, we analyze how their quantum decoherence\nevolves with doping density and determine the condition under which stable\nFermi polarons form. Because of the large oscillator strength associated with\nthese resonances, intrinsic quantum dynamics of polarons as well as valley\ncoherence between coupled singlet- and triplet polarons occur on sub-picosecond\ntime scales. Surprisingly, we find that a dark-to-bright state conversion\nprocess leads to a particularly long-lived singlet polaron valley polarization,\npersisting up to 200-800 ps. Valley coherence between the singlet- and triplet\npolaron is correlated with their energy fluctuations.

Nonetheless, the\ntechnologies used for personalization have evolved alongside the development of\ngenerative models, with their distinct and interrelated components. In this\nsurvey, we present a comprehensive review of generalized personalized image\ngeneration across various generative models, including traditional GANs,\ncontemporary text-to-image diffusion models, and emerging multi-model\nautoregressive models.

    "abstract":"Controlling hypersonic surface acoustic waves is crucial for advanced\nphononic devices such as high-frequency filters, sensors, and quantum computing\ncomponents. While periodic phononic crystals enable precise bandgap\nengineering, their ability to suppress acoustic waves is limited to specific\nfrequency ranges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the control of surface\nacoustic waves using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a\nlithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure exhibits characteristics of\nboth random and ordered systems, leading to an overall reduction in acoustic\ntransmission and the formation of bandgap-like regions where phonon propagation\nis strongly suppressed. We further demonstrate effective waveguiding by\nincorporating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern.\nBoth simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the\nwaveguides at frequencies within the bandgaps, demonstrating the flexibility of\nhyperuniform structures to support waveguides of complex shapes.

The first part of this study identified\nthe critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates,\ndeveloped a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a\nspecial phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches\nzero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference\nbetween droplets. These findings align well with prior micro-level studies and\nexperimental predictions. The second part of this study investigated the\njumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon\na stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and\nwettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case.\nScaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution\ncoefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re)\nnumber. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts.\nFor superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three\ntimes the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless\nspreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases,\nthe jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for\nconversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation.\nFor the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant\nat high-impact droplet velocities. About 1% of the energy is dissipated due to\nsurface adhesion, which reduces at higher impact velocity.",

Here, we used MD and GCMC\nsimulations and studied H-diffusion deformation at polycrystalline scale with\natomic resolution efficiently. To study H-free surface interactions, large\npillars including all possible angles and planes of free surfaces were modeled.\nTo study H-grain boundary interactions, several polycrystalline models\ncontaining comparable statistics of low and high angle grain boundaries were\nexamined. We studied the statistics of H-segregation tendencies based on free\nsurface angles and grain boundary types. Dislocation activities were also\nclassified for these various types and total density and strength were compared\nand analyzed compared to H-free samples. In the free surface model, it was\nobserved that H was evenly distributed along the model's surface. Although the\ndislocation density was reduced compared to H-free samples, localized bands of\ndislocations were produced. Additionally in the polycrystalline samples, it was\nconcluded that H tends to segregate along grain boundaries with misorientation\nangles less than or equal to 25 degrees. However, specific misorientation angle\ninteractions -- namely $>45$ degrees -- led to increased dislocation density in\nH-charged samples compared to their H-free counterparts.",

    "abstract":"State Space Models (SSMs), as key components of Mamaba, have gained\nincreasing attention for vision models recently, thanks to their efficient long\nsequence modeling capability. Given the computational cost of deploying SSMs on\nresource-limited edge devices, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a technique\nwith the potential for efficient deployment of SSMs. In this work, we propose\nQMamba, one of the first PTQ frameworks to our knowledge, designed for vision\nSSMs based on the analysis of the activation distributions in SSMs. We reveal\nthat the distribution of discrete parameters exhibits long-tailed skewness and\nthe distribution of the hidden state sequence exhibits highly dynamic\nvariations. Correspondingly, we design Long-tailed Skewness Quantization (LtSQ)\nto quantize discrete parameters and Temporal Group Quantization (TGQ) to\nquantize hidden states, which reduces the quantization errors. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QMamba outperforms advanced PTQ methods on vision\nmodels across multiple model sizes and architectures. Notably, QMamba surpasses\nexisting methods by 21.0% on ImageNet classification with 4-bit activations.",

    "abstract":"Reasoning and strategic behavior in social interactions is a hallmark of\nintelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than\nisolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem\nsolving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and\nNegotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the\nintelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing\nbenchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench\ncombines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games,\nand multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework\nincludes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the\nvariety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI\nagents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action\nspaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a\nvariety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and\nstep-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial\nor cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary\nLLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they\nencounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop\nreasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under\nuncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust\nmulti-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming. Project Website:\nhttps:\/\/spinbench.github.io\/",

    "abstract":"Quantized charge transport through a 1D ballistic channel was famously\nexplained decades ago by Rolf Landauer, by considering local injection of\ncharge carriers from two contacts at the ends of the 1D channel. With the rise\nof quantum (spin\/anomalous) Hall insulators, i.e., 2D material systems with\nballistic 1D edge states along their perimeter, a different geometry has become\nrelevant: The distributed injection of charge carriers from a 2D half-plane\nwith residual conductivity into the 1D edge channel.

    "abstract":"Self-driven photodetectors (SDPDs) transform photon energy into electrical\nenergy without external voltage, which makes them highly advantageous for\napplications such as low-power communication and imaging systems.\nTwo-dimensional materials (2DMs) provide ideal platforms for SDPDs thanks to\ntheir band structures covering ultraviolet to infrared spectrum, strong light\nabsorption efficiencies, and high carrier mobilities. However, the lack of\nstable doping methods and the complicated 2DMs multilayer stacking techniques\npose tremendous difficulties for 2DMs to adopt the same device structures (i.e.\nPN junctions) as bulk materials, and the resultant self-driven performance\nremains at a low level. This work reveals how different asymmetrical effects\ncan be combined to synergistically boost self-driven properties based on\ntypical 2D metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors. Using WSe2 as an\nexemplary 2D material to build MSM photodetectors, the synergistic effect of\nasymmetrical contact electrodes and asymmetrical contact geometries is\ntheoretically and experimentally demonstrated. The open-circuit voltage (Voc)\nof the SDPD reaches 0.58V, with a zero-bias responsivity of 5.77 A\/W and an\non\/off ratio of 1.73*10^5. Additionally, our devices demonstrate potential for\nvisible light communication (VLC) in underwater environments. Our results offer\na promising and efficient strategy for building SDPDs based on various 2DMs and\npave the way toward low-power optoelectronic applications.",

However, state-of-the-art CC\nalgorithms struggle to perform well across diverse workloads, and most do not\nconsider workload drifts.\n  In this paper, we propose CCaaLF (Concurrency Control as a Learnable\nFunction), a novel learned concurrency control algorithm designed to achieve\nhigh performance across varying workloads. The algorithm is quick to optimize,\nmaking it robust against dynamic workloads. CCaaLF learns an agent function\nthat captures a large number of design choices from existing CC algorithms. The\nfunction is implemented as an efficient in-database lookup table that maps\ndatabase states to concurrency control actions. The learning process is based\non a combination of Bayesian optimization and a novel graph reduction\nalgorithm, which converges quickly to a function that achieves high transaction\nthroughput. We compare CCaaLF against five state-of-the-art CC algorithms and\nshow that our algorithm consistently outperforms them in terms of transaction\nthroughput and optimization time.",

    "abstract":"Currently, there are few effective methods for synthesizing a mass of\nhigh-resolution rainy images in complex illumination conditions. However, these\nmethods are essential for synthesizing large-scale high-quality paired\nrainy-clean image datasets, which can train deep learning-based single image\nrain removal models capable of generalizing to various illumination conditions.\nTherefore, we propose a practical two-stage learning-from-rendering pipeline\nfor high-resolution rainy image synthesis. The pipeline combines the benefits\nof the realism of rendering-based methods and the high-efficiency of\nlearning-based methods, providing the possibility of creating large-scale\nhigh-quality paired rainy-clean image datasets. In the rendering stage, we use\na rendering-based method to create a High-resolution Rainy Image (HRI) dataset,\nwhich contains realistic high-resolution paired rainy-clean images of multiple\nscenes and various illumination conditions. In the learning stage, to learn\nillumination information from background images for high-resolution rainy image\ngeneration, we propose a High-resolution Rainy Image Generation Network\n(HRIGNet). HRIGNet is designed to introduce a guiding diffusion model in the\nLatent Diffusion Model, which provides additional guidance information for\nhigh-resolution image synthesis. In our experiments, HRIGNet is able to\nsynthesize high-resolution rainy images up to 2048x1024 resolution. Rain\nremoval experiments on real dataset validate that our method can help improve\nthe robustness of deep derainers to real rainy images.

While significant progress has been made in developing\nobjective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models\nheavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to\nScaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a\npredictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models.\nTherefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual\nquality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring\nthe largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the\nmentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image\nand text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on\nvisual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos).\nLeveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified\nmodel capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special\nimprovements for handling long-text prompt alignment.

    "abstract":"Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained\nmachine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security.\nHowever, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather\nlimited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model)\nconsiders minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I\nmodel for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the\nmachine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained\nmodel will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not\ngenerate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we\nconsider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer\nrecognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To\nachieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with\ngradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with\ntheoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-unlearning\nguarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is\nfurther fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We\nalso propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively\nremoved the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two\nlarge-scale datasets, ImageNet-1K and Places365 highlights the superiority of\nour approach. To show comparable performance with retrained model, we also show\nthe comparison of a simple AutoEncoder on various baselines on CIFAR-10\ndataset.",

Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise\nfor advancing automation and precision in testing.

To address this\ngap, we introduce the Test and Measurement Intelligence Quotient (TMIQ), a\nbenchmark designed to quantitatively assess LLMs across a wide range of\nelectronic engineering tasks.

In testing\nvarious LLMs, our findings indicate varying levels of proficiency, with exact\nSCPI command match accuracy ranging from around 56% to 73%, and ranked matching\nfirst-position scores achieving around 33% for the best-performing model. We\nalso assess token usage, cost-efficiency, and response times, identifying\ntrade-offs between accuracy and operational efficiency. Additionally, we\npresent a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate\ndatasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs.\nTMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs\nfor production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying\nstrengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections\nfor applications within the Test and Measurement industry.",

    "abstract":"We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray observations obtained from\n\\xmm\\, and \\chandra\\, for a sample of bona-fide Compact Symmetric Objects\n(CSOs) to investigate their X-ray emission properties. Ultimately, we obtain 32\neffective X-ray observational spectra from 17 CSOs. Most spectra can be well\ndescribed by an absorbed single power-law model, with the exception of 6\nspectra requiring an additional component in the soft X-ray band and 2 spectra\nexhibiting an iron emission line component. The data analysis results unveil\nthe diverse characteristics of X-ray emission from CSOs. The sample covers\nX-ray luminosity ranging within $10^{40}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, intrinsic\nabsorbing column density ($N_{\\rm H}^{\\rm int}$) ranging within\n$10^{20}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and photon spectral index ($\\Gamma_{\\rm X}$)\nranging within 0.75--3.0. None of the CSOs in our sample have $N_{\\rm H}^{\\rm\nint}$ > $10^{23}\\rm~cm^{-2}$, indicating that the X-ray emission in these CSOs\nis not highly obscured. The distribution of $\\Gamma_{\\rm X}$ for these CSOs\nclosely resembles that observed in a sample of radio-loud quasars and\nlow-excitation radio galaxies (RGs). In the radio--X-ray luminosity panel,\nthese CSOs exhibit a distribution more akin to FR I RGs than FR II RGs,\ncharacterized by higher luminosities. The positive correlation between\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm X}$ and the Eddington ratio, which has been noted in radio-quiet\nactive galactic nuclei, is not observed in these CSOs. These findings suggest\nthat although the contribution of the disk-corona system cannot be completely\nruled out, jet\/lobe radiation likely plays a dominant role in the X-ray\nemission of these CSOs.",

We improve the \\(3.68k\\)-stretch to\n\\(2.64k\\)-stretch by allowing every vertex to use \\(\\tilde{O}(n^{1\/k})\\) local\nstorage on average. This resolves a key open question by demonstrating the\nexistence of a routing scheme with stretch \\(c \\cdot k\\) for some constant\n\\(c<3\\).\n  More than two decades ago, Thorup and Zwick [SPAA 2001] considered compact\nrouting schemes that establish a communication session using a handshake. In\ntheir handshake-based compact routing scheme, the handshake is routed along a\n\\((4k-5)\\)-stretch path, and the rest of the communication session is routed\nalong an optimal \\((2k-1)\\)-stretch path. It is straightforward to improve the\n\\((4k-5)\\)-stretch path of the handshake to \\(3.68k\\)-stretch using the compact\nrouting scheme of Chechik [PODC 2013]. We improve the handshake stretch to the\noptimal \\((2k-1)\\), by introducing the concept of roundtrip routing in\nundirected graphs and developing an optimal \\((2k-1)\\)-stretch compact\nroundtrip routing scheme, which is of independent interest.\n  For weighted directed graphs, more than two decades ago, Roditty, Thorup, and\nZwick [SODA 2002, TALG 2008] presented a \\((4k+\\varepsilon)\\)-stretch compact\nroundtrip routing scheme that uses \\(\\tilde{O}(n^{1\/k})\\) local storage for\nevery \\(k\\ge 3\\). For \\(k=3\\), this gives a \\((12+\\varepsilon)\\)-roundtrip\nstretch using \\(\\tilde{O}(n^{1\/3})\\) local storage.

    "abstract":"Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for\nskeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model\nspatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based\nmethods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal\ntopology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2)\nthey struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint\nconnectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called\nDynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network\n(DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph\nConvolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and\nMulti-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel\nto independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations,\nenabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations.\nAdditionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture\nmultiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances\ntemporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse\nreceptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN\nsignificantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action\nrecognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\\\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.",

    "title":"Token-Efficient Long Video Understanding for Multimodal LLMs",
    "abstract":"Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs)\nhave significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as\nsequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames\nindependently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which\nlimits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long\nvideos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM\n(\\textbf{S}patiotemporal \\textbf{TO}ken \\textbf{R}eduction for\n\\textbf{M}ultimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated\ntemporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder\nleverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into\nimage tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame\ndynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only\nenhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token\nreduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal\nand spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM\nwithout sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques,\nour approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while\nimproving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over\nextended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves\nstate-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks\n(more than 5\\% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the\ncomputation costs by up to $8\\times$ and the decoding latency by\n2.4-2.9$\\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

    "abstract":"The Terahertz band holds a promise to enable both super-accurate sensing and\nultra-fast communication. However, challenges arise that severe Doppler effects\ncall for a waveform with high Doppler robustness while severe propagation path\nloss urges for an ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO)\nstructure. To tackle these challenges, hybrid beamforming with orthogonal\ndelay-Doppler multiplexing modulation (ODDM) is investigated in this paper.\nFirst, the integration of delay-Doppler waveform and MIMO is explored by\nderiving a hybrid beamforming-based UM-MIMO ODDM input-output relation. Then, a\nmulti-dimension sensing algorithm on target azimuth angle, elevation angle,\nrange and velocity is proposed, which features low complexity and high\naccuracy. Finally, a sensing-centric hybrid beamforming is proposed to design\nthe sensing combiner by minimizing the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of\nangles. After that, the precoder that affects both communication and sensing is\nthen designed to maximize the spectral efficiency. Numerical results show that\nthe sensing accuracy of the proposed sensing algorithm is sufficiently close to\nCRLB. Moreover, the proposed hybrid beamforming design allows to achieve\nmaximal spectral efficiency, millimeter-level range estimation accuracy,\nmillidegree-level angle estimation accuracy and millimeter-per-second-level\nvelocity estimation accuracy. Take-away lessons are two-fold. Combiner design\nis critical especially for sensing, which is commonly neglected in hybrid\nbeamforming design for communication. Furthermore, the optimization problems\nfor communication and sensing can be decoupled and solved independently,\nsignificantly reducing the computational complexity of the THz monostatic ISAC\nsystem.",

    "title":"ConceptVAE: Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Concept Disentanglement from 2D\n  Echocardiographies",
    "abstract":"While traditional self-supervised learning methods improve performance and\nrobustness across various medical tasks, they rely on single-vector embeddings\nthat may not capture fine-grained concepts such as anatomical structures or\norgans. The ability to identify such concepts and their characteristics without\nsupervision has the potential to improve pre-training methods, and enable novel\napplications such as fine-grained image retrieval and concept-based outlier\ndetection. In this paper, we introduce ConceptVAE, a novel pre-training\nframework that detects and disentangles fine-grained concepts from their style\ncharacteristics in a self-supervised manner. We present a suite of loss terms\nand model architecture primitives designed to discretise input data into a\npreset number of concepts along with their local style. We validate ConceptVAE\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating its ability to detect\nfine-grained anatomical structures such as blood pools and septum walls from 2D\ncardiac echocardiographies. Quantitatively, ConceptVAE outperforms traditional\nself-supervised methods in tasks such as region-based instance retrieval,\nsemantic segmentation, out-of-distribution detection, and object detection.\nAdditionally, we explore the generation of in-distribution synthetic data that\nmaintains the same concepts as the training data but with distinct styles,\nhighlighting its potential for more calibrated data generation. Overall, our\nstudy introduces and validates a promising new pre-training technique based on\nconcept-style disentanglement, opening multiple avenues for developing models\nfor medical image analysis that are more interpretable and explainable than\nblack-box approaches.",

    "abstract":"This paper proposes a new compression paradigm -- Guaranteed Conditional\nDiffusion with Tensor Correction (GCDTC) -- for lossy scientific data\ncompression. The framework is based on recent conditional diffusion (CD)\ngenerative models, and it consists of a conditional diffusion model, tensor\ncorrection, and error guarantee. Our diffusion model is a mixture of 3D\nconditioning and 2D denoising U-Net. The approach leverages a 3D block-based\ncompressing module to address spatiotemporal correlations in structured\nscientific data. Then, the reverse diffusion process for 2D spatial data is\nconditioned on the ``slices'' of content latent variables produced by the\ncompressing module. After training, the denoising decoder reconstructs the data\nwith zero noise and content latent variables, and thus it is entirely\ndeterministic. The reconstructed outputs of the CD model are further\npost-processed by our tensor correction and error guarantee steps to control\nand ensure a maximum error distortion, which is an inevitable requirement in\nlossy scientific data compression. Our experiments involving two datasets\ngenerated by climate and chemical combustion simulations show that our\nframework outperforms standard convolutional autoencoders and yields\ncompetitive compression quality with an existing scientific data compression\nalgorithm.",

    "abstract":"Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) are fundamental to modeling\ncomplex systems in physics, finance, and engineering, yet their numerical\nestimation remains a formidable challenge. Traditional methods rely on\ndiscretization, introducing computational inefficiencies, and limiting\napplicability in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce a novel\nneural framework for SPDE estimation that eliminates the need for\ndiscretization, enabling direct estimation of expected values across arbitrary\nspatio-temporal points. We develop and compare two distinct neural\narchitectures: Loss Enforced Conditions (LEC), which integrates physical\nconstraints into the loss function, and Model Enforced Conditions (MEC), which\nembeds these constraints directly into the network structure. Through extensive\nexperiments on the stochastic heat equation, Burgers' equation, and\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, we reveal a trade-off: While LEC achieves\nsuperior residual minimization and generalization, MEC enforces initial\nconditions with absolute precision and exceptionally high accuracy in boundary\ncondition enforcement. Our findings highlight the immense potential of\nneural-based SPDE solvers, particularly for high-dimensional problems where\nconventional techniques falter. By circumventing discretization and explicitly\nmodeling uncertainty, our approach opens new avenues for solving SPDEs in\nfields ranging from quantitative finance to turbulence modeling. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first neural framework capable of directly\nestimating the expected values of SPDEs in an entirely non-discretized manner,\noffering a step forward in scientific computing.",

    "title":"Exploring Unbiased Deepfake Detection via Token-Level Shuffling and\n  Mixing",
    "abstract":"The generalization problem is broadly recognized as a critical challenge in\ndetecting deepfakes. Most previous work believes that the generalization gap is\ncaused by the differences among various forgery methods. However, our\ninvestigation reveals that the generalization issue can still occur when\nforgery-irrelevant factors shift. In this work, we identify two biases that\ndetectors may also be prone to overfitting: position bias and content bias, as\ndepicted in Fig. 1. For the position bias, we observe that detectors are prone\nto lazily depending on the specific positions within an image (e.g., central\nregions even no forgery). As for content bias, we argue that detectors may\npotentially and mistakenly utilize forgery-unrelated information for detection\n(e.g., background, and hair). To intervene these biases, we propose two\nbranches for shuffling and mixing with tokens in the latent space of\ntransformers. For the shuffling branch, we rearrange the tokens and\ncorresponding position embedding for each image while maintaining the local\ncorrelation. For the mixing branch, we randomly select and mix the tokens in\nthe latent space between two images with the same label within the mini-batch\nto recombine the content information. During the learning process, we align the\noutputs of detectors from different branches in both feature space and logit\nspace. Contrastive losses for features and divergence losses for logits are\napplied to obtain unbiased feature representation and classifiers. We\ndemonstrate and verify the effectiveness of our method through extensive\nexperiments on widely used evaluation datasets.",

This problem typically exhibits a dichotomy whereby for some values of\n$s$, the extremal graph is the `trivial' one, namely the Tur\\'an graph on $k-1$\nparts, with no copies of $K_k$; while for others, this graph is no longer\nextremal and determining the extremal graph becomes much harder.\n  We generalise a framework developed for the monochromatic\nErd\\H{o}s-Rothschild problem to the general setting and work in this framework\nto obtain our main results, which concern two specific forbidden families:\ntriangles with exactly two colours, and improperly coloured cliques.

    "abstract":"To date, nearly all the reported Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) are straight\ncrested LWRs, which suffer from inherent spurious modes and low quality factors\n(Q). For the first time, this work demonstrates a circular crested LWR. Its\nadvantages over the straight crested LWR are presented comprehensively by\nstudying their fundamental symmetric (S0) mode, which is the simplest and most\nrepresentative Lamb wave mode. Utilizing circular crested Lamb waves, the\nproposed resonator avoids only utilizing waves propagating in the lateral\ndirection in the straight crested LWRs, thus eliminating the transverse\nspurious modes as no transverse direction exists. Besides, different from\nstraight crested Lamb waves maintaining the same displacement amplitude along\nthe propagation direction, circular crested Lamb waves exhibit displacement\nattenuation toward device edges, which effectively concentrates energy in the\ndevice center, assists in reducing energy loss through anchors, and improves Q.\nBased on 20 at.% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (Al0.8Sc0.2N) thin films, the\nmicrofabricated circular crested LWR effectively suppresses transverse spurious\nmodes and achieves a 40.7% Q improvement in experiments with no degradation in\neffective electromechanical coupling coefficients (keff2) compared with the\nconventional straight crested LWR when working in S0 mode in experiments, in\ncontrast with the conventional straight crested LWR which shows inherent\nexperimental transverse spurious modes. Moreover, the free edges covered by top\nelectrodes enhance device robustness against misalignment and over-etching in\nthe fabrication process. With the advantages of spurious mode suppression, Q\nenhancement, and fabrication robustness, the circular crested LWR is a\npromising candidate for next-generation filters and oscillators.",

In HGs, the aim is to partition agents into\ncoalitions according to their preferences which solely depend on the coalition\nthey are assigned to. Under FA preferences, agents consider any other agent\neither a friend or an enemy, preferring coalitions with more friends and, in\ncase of ties, the ones with fewer enemies. Our goal is to design mechanisms\nthat prevent manipulations while optimizing social welfare.\n  Prior research established that computing a welfare maximizing (optimum)\npartition for FA preferences is not strategyproof, and the best-known\napproximation to the optimum subject to strategyproofness is linear in the\nnumber of agents. In this work, we explore NOM to improve approximation\nresults. We first prove the existence of a NOM mechanism that always outputs\nthe optimum; however, we also demonstrate that the computation of an optimal\npartition is NP-hard. To address this complexity, we focus on approximation\nmechanisms and propose a NOM mechanism guaranteeing a $(4+o(1))$-approximation\nin polynomial time.\n  Finally, we briefly discuss NOM in the case of Enemies Aversion (EA)\npreferences, the counterpart of FA, where agents give priority to coalitions\nwith fewer enemies and show that no mechanism computing the optimum can be NOM.",

    "abstract":"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements\nin recent years, with visual features playing an increasingly critical role in\nenhancing model performance. However, the integration of multi-layer visual\nfeatures in MLLMs remains underexplored, particularly with regard to optimal\nlayer selection and fusion strategies. Existing methods often rely on arbitrary\ndesign choices, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate two core aspects of multi-layer visual feature\nfusion: (1) selecting the most effective visual layers and (2) identifying the\nbest fusion approach with the language model. Our experiments reveal that while\ncombining visual features from multiple stages improves generalization,\nincorporating additional features from the same stage typically leads to\ndiminished performance. Furthermore, we find that direct fusion of multi-layer\nvisual features at the input stage consistently yields superior and more stable\nperformance across various configurations.

Our findings also reveal the dominant influence of the United\nStates across all groups, while South Korean content, particularly after the\nsuccess of \"Squid Game\" in 2021, has gained and sustained popularity in Asia\nand Middle East and Latin America.

    "abstract":"The advancement of visual language models (VLMs) has enhanced mobile device\noperations, allowing simulated human-like actions to address user requirements.\nCurrent VLM-based mobile operating assistants can be structured into three\nlevels: task, subtask, and action. The subtask level, linking high-level goals\nwith low-level executable actions, is crucial for task completion but faces two\nchallenges: ineffective subtasks that lower-level agent cannot execute and\ninefficient subtasks that fail to contribute to the completion of the\nhigher-level task. These challenges stem from VLM's lack of experience in\ndecomposing subtasks within GUI scenarios in multi-agent architecture. To\naddress these, we propose a new mobile assistant architecture with constrained\nhigh-frequency o}ptimized planning (CHOP). Our approach overcomes the VLM's\ndeficiency in GUI scenarios planning by using human-planned subtasks as the\nbasis vector. We evaluate our architecture in both English and Chinese contexts\nacross 20 Apps, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness\nand efficiency.

    "abstract":"The coupling between quasiparticles and bosonic excitations rules the energy\ntransfer pathways in condensed matter systems. The possibility of inferring the\nstrength of specific coupling channels from their characteristic time scales\nmeasured in nonequilibrium experiments is still an open question. Here, we\ninvestigate MgB$_2$, in which conventional superconductivity at temperatures as\nhigh as 39 K is mediated by the strong coupling between the conduction\nelectrons and the E$_{2g}$ phonon mode. By means of broadband time-resolved\noptical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling\ndictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$ at early times (<100\nfs) after photoexcitation. Furthermore, based on an effective temperature model\nanalysis, we estimate its contribution to the total electron-boson coupling\nfunction extracted from complementary equilibrium spectroscopy approaches,\nnamely optical reflectivity and ARPES. The coupling strength with the E$_{2g}$\nphonon modes is thus estimated to be $\\lambda$ ~ 0.56, which is approximately\nhalf of the total coupling constant, in agreement with ab-initio calculations\nfrom the literature. As a benchmark, broadband time-resolved optical\nspectroscopy is performed also on the isostructural and non-superconducting\ncompound AlB$_2$, showing that the nonequilibrium optical response relaxes on a\nslower timescale due to the lack of strongly-coupled phonon modes. Our findings\ndemonstrate the possibility to resolve and quantify selective electron-phonon\ncoupling from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy.",

    "abstract":"Root cause analysis is one of the most crucial operations in software\nreliability regarding system performance diagnostic. It aims to identify the\nroot causes of system performance anomalies, allowing the resolution or the\nfuture prevention of issues that can cause millions of dollars in losses.\nCommon existing approaches relying on data correlation or full domain expert\nknowledge are inaccurate or infeasible in most industrial cases, since\ncorrelation does not imply causation, and domain experts may not have full\nknowledge of complex and real-time systems. In this work, we define a novel\ncausal domain knowledge model representing causal relations about the\nunderlying system components to allow domain experts to contribute partial\ndomain knowledge for root cause analysis. We then introduce RADICE, an\nalgorithm that through the causal graph discovery, enhancement, refinement, and\nsubtraction processes is able to output a root cause causal sub-graph showing\nthe causal relations between the system components affected by the anomaly. We\nevaluated RADICE with simulated data and reported a real data use case, sharing\nthe lessons we learned.

    "abstract":"Data replication is crucial for enabling fault tolerance and uniform low\nlatency in modern decentralized applications. Replicated Data Types (RDTs) have\nemerged as a principled approach for developing replicated implementations of\nbasic data structures such as counter, flag, set, map, etc. While the\ncorrectness of RDTs is generally specified using the notion of strong eventual\nconsistency--which guarantees that replicas that have received the same set of\nupdates would converge to the same state--a more expressive specification which\nrelates the converged state to updates received at a replica would be more\nbeneficial to RDT users. Replication-aware linearizability is one such\nspecification, which requires all replicas to always be in a state which can be\nobtained by linearizing the updates received at the replica. In this work, we\ndevelop a novel fully automated technique for verifying replication-aware\nlinearizability for Mergeable Replicated Data Types (MRDTs). We identify novel\nalgebraic properties for MRDT operations and the merge function which are\nsufficient for proving an implementation to be linearizable and which go beyond\nthe standard notions of commutativity, associativity, and idempotence. We also\ndevelop a novel inductive technique called bottom-up linearization to\nautomatically verify the required algebraic properties. Our technique can be\nused to verify both MRDTs and state-based CRDTs. We have successfully applied\nour approach to a number of complex MRDT and CRDT implementations including a\nnovel JSON MRDT.",

We establish a regret lower bound\nfor this problem under the novel feedback structure and introduce two upper\nconfidence bound (UCB)-based algorithms: Double-UCB, which has\nproblem-independent regret upper bounds, and Conservative-UCB, which has\nproblem-dependent upper bounds. Leveraging the similarity structure, we also\nexplore a scenario where the number of arms increases over time (referred to as\nthe \\emph{ballooning setting}). Practical applications of this scenario include\nQ\\&A platforms (e.g., Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora) and product reviews on\nplatforms like Amazon and Flipkart, where answers (or reviews) continuously\nappear, and the goal is to display the best ones at the top. We extend these\ntwo UCB-based algorithms to the ballooning setting. Under mild assumptions, we\nprovide regret upper bounds for both algorithms and discuss their\nsub-linearity.

    "title":"DNRSelect: Active Best View Selection for Deferred Neural Rendering",
    "abstract":"Deferred neural rendering (DNR) is an emerging computer graphics pipeline\ndesigned for high-fidelity rendering and robotic perception. However, DNR\nheavily relies on datasets composed of numerous ray-traced images and demands\nsubstantial computational resources. It remains under-explored how to reduce\nthe reliance on high-quality ray-traced images while maintaining the rendering\nfidelity. In this paper, we propose DNRSelect, which integrates a reinforcement\nlearning-based view selector and a 3D texture aggregator for deferred neural\nrendering. We first propose a novel view selector for deferred neural rendering\nbased on reinforcement learning, which is trained on easily obtained rasterized\nimages to identify the optimal views. By acquiring only a few ray-traced images\nfor these selected views, the selector enables DNR to achieve high-quality\nrendering. To further enhance spatial awareness and geometric consistency in\nDNR, we introduce a 3D texture aggregator that fuses pyramid features from\ndepth maps and normal maps with UV maps. Given that acquiring ray-traced images\nis more time-consuming than generating rasterized images, DNRSelect minimizes\nthe need for ray-traced data by using only a few selected views while still\nachieving high-fidelity rendering results. We conduct detailed experiments and\nablation studies on the NeRF-Synthetic dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof DNRSelect. The code will be released.",

To\novercome this, we introduce MAREA, an O-RAN-compliant mathematical framework\ndesigned for the allocation of radio resources to multiple ultra-Reliable Low\nLatency Communication (uRLLC) services. In the near-real-time (RT) control\nloop, MAREA employs a novel Martingales-based model to determine the guaranteed\nradio resources for each uRLLC service. Unlike traditional queueing theory\napproaches, this model ensures that the probability of packet transmission\ndelays exceeding a predefined threshold -- the violation probability -- remains\nbelow a target tolerance.\n  Additionally, MAREA uses a real-time control loop to monitor transmission\nqueues and dynamically adjust guaranteed radio resources in response to traffic\nanomalies. To the best of our knowledge, MAREA is the first O-RAN-compliant\nsolution that leverages Martingales for both near-RT and RT control loops.\nSimulations demonstrate that MAREA significantly outperforms reference\nsolutions, achieving an average violation probability that is x10 lower.",

    "abstract":"Heart rate (HR) estimation via remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a\nnon-invasive solution for health monitoring. However, traditional\nsingle-modality approaches (RGB or Radio Frequency (RF)) face challenges in\nbalancing robustness and accuracy due to lighting variations, motion artifacts,\nand skin tone bias. In this paper, we propose CardiacMamba, a multimodal RGB-RF\nfusion framework that leverages the complementary strengths of both modalities.\nIt introduces the Temporal Difference Mamba Module (TDMM) to capture dynamic\nchanges in RF signals using timing differences between frames, enhancing the\nextraction of local and global features. Additionally, CardiacMamba employs a\nBidirectional SSM for cross-modal alignment and a Channel-wise Fast Fourier\nTransform (CFFT) to effectively capture and refine the frequency domain\ncharacteristics of RGB and RF signals, ultimately improving heart rate\nestimation accuracy and periodicity detection. Extensive experiments on the\nEquiPleth dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving marked\nimprovements in accuracy and robustness. CardiacMamba significantly mitigates\nskin tone bias, reducing performance disparities across demographic groups, and\nmaintains resilience under missing-modality scenarios. By addressing critical\nchallenges in fairness, adaptability, and precision, the framework advances\nrPPG technology toward reliable real-world deployment in healthcare.

Here, we propose an experimentally advantageous scheme to detect the\nLBW signal by irradiating a foil target with a single 10 PW-level laser. Our\nintegrated QED particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that the LBW signal can\nbe explicitly distinguished from the Bethe-Heitler (BH) signal by comparing\npositron energy spectra behind the target at varying target thicknesses. The\nLBW positrons are created at the front of the target and subsequently\nexperience both laser vacuum acceleration and sheath field acceleration to gain\nhigh energies, while BH positrons, originating within the target bulk, are only\nsubjected to sheath field acceleration. As a result, the invariance of the\nhigh-energy tail of positron spectra with respect to the target thickness\nserves as a distinct signature of the LBW process. Notably, this scheme remains\nviable even when the BH yield dominates over the LBW yield.",

Actually,\nthe Boltzmann equation is closely linked to the quantum density matrix,\nalthough term-by-term correspondence between the two is yet to be established.\nHere we start from the quantum Liouville equation in the interactive picture\nand show that the diagonal components of the equation yield the Boltzmann\nequation in homogeneous systems in an applied uniform electric field in the\nsemiclassical limit, while the off-diagonal components give the anomalous\nvelocity induced by Berry curvature and the side-jump velocity. The\nskew-scattering contribution is obtained when we include corrections beyond the\nfirst-Born approximation. The result derived from the denstiy matrix agrees\nwith the semiclassical one from wave-packet analysis, showing that the\nsemiclassical Boltzmann equation is more than an equation built from intuition,\nand it can be derived with the density matrix.

    "abstract":"We present a mechanism to generate unidirectional pulse-shaped propagating\nwaves, tamed to exponential growth and dispersion, in active systems with\nnonreciprocal and nonlinear couplings. In particular, when all bulk modes are\nexponentially localized at one side of the lattice (skin effect), it is\nexpected that wave dynamics is governed by amplification or decay until\nreaching the boundaries, even in the presence of dissipation. Our analytical\nresults, and experimental demonstrations in an active electrical transmission\nline metamaterial, reveal that nonlinearity is a crucial tuning parameter in\nmediating a delicate interplay between nonreciprocity, dispersion, and\ndissipation. Consequently, undistorted unidirectional solitonic pulses are\nsupported both for low and high nonreciprocity and pulse amplitude strength.\nThe proposed mechanism facilitates robust pulse propagation in signal\nprocessing and energy transmission applications.",

    "abstract":"We develop a rigorous framework for quantifying quantum coherence in\nfinite-dimensional systems by applying the Schur-Horn majorization theorem to\nrelate eigenvalue distributions and diagonal entries of density matrices.\nBuilding on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence\nmeasures, including the relative cross-entropy of coherence and its partial\nvariants, that satisfy all resource theoretic axioms under incoherent\noperations. This unifying approach clarifies the geometric boundaries of\nphysically realizable states in von Neumann-Tsallis entropy space and uncovers\nthe phenomenon of degenerate coherence distillation where symmetry in the\neigenvalue spectrum enables enhanced coherence extraction in higher-dimensional\nsystems. In addition, we strengthen the entropy-based uncertainty relation by\nrefining the Massen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across\ndistinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between\nentropy and uncertainty, which yields operationally meaningful constraints for\nquantum information tasks. Altogether, our findings illustrate the power of\nmajorization in resource-theoretic analyses of quantum coherence, which offer\nvaluable tools for both fundamental research and real-world applications in\nquantum information processing.",

    "abstract":"The scale invariance of accretion processes (SIAP) is crucial for\nunderstanding the physical processes of black hole accretion systems at\ndifferent scales. When applying this rule to high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations (HFQPOs), there is an observation-theory confrontation in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found\nthat the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black\nhole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated\naccretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even\nthough many AGNs still do not. Furthermore, we report a new HFQPO candidate in\nNGC 5506. This source exhibits an accretion state similar to that of Sgr A* and\nNGC 1365, and it also supports the HFQPO models. Our results are consistent\nwith previous numerical simulations and suggest that the accretion state of\nHFQPOs in SMBHs may differ from that of stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). To\nreconcile the sources that do not support the models, either a global\ngeneral-relativistic HFQPO model based on magnetohydrodynamics needs to be\nconsidered, or the HFQPOs in these sources may originate from entirely\ndifferent physical processes. This discovery significantly extends the SIAP\nrule to a broader scale, confirming that the paradigm of accretion scale\ninvariance remains consistent from SBHs to SMBHs.",

    "abstract":"The limitations of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have\nspurred the development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), which hold\nthe potential to achieve quantum advantage for specific tasks. Quantum\nArchitecture Search (QAS) algorithms are pivotal in automating the design of\nhigh-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However,\nexisting QAS algorithms grapple with excessively large search spaces, resulting\nin significant computational complexity when searching large-scale quantum\ncircuits. To address this challenge, we propose a Topology-Driven Quantum\nArchitecture Search (TD-QAS) framework. Our framework initially employs QAS to\nidentify optimal circuit topologies and subsequently utilizes an efficient QAS\nto fine-tune gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters\nfrom the topology search phase, thereby eliminating the need to train from\nscratch. By decoupling the extensive search space into topology and gate-type\ncomponents, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance\ntopologies, significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical\nsimulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy scenario,\ndemonstrate that the TD-QAS framework enhances the efficiency of QAS algorithms\nby enabling them to identify high-performance quantum circuits with lower\ncomputational complexity. These results suggest that TD-QAS will deepen our\nunderstanding of VQA and have broad applicability in future QAS algorithms.",

    "abstract":"In video recommendation systems, user behaviors such as watch time, likes,\nand follows are commonly used to infer user interest. However, these behaviors\nare influenced by various biases, including duration bias, demographic biases,\nand content category biases, which obscure true user preferences. In this\npaper, we hypothesize that biases and user interest are independent of each\nother. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel method that aligns\npredicted behavior distributions across different bias conditions using\nquantile mapping, theoretically guaranteeing zero mutual information between\nbias variables and the true user interest. By explicitly modeling the\nconditional distributions of user behaviors under different biases and mapping\nthese behaviors to quantiles, we effectively decouple user interest from the\nconfounding effects of various biases. Our approach uniquely handles both\ncontinuous signals (e.g., watch time) and discrete signals (e.g., likes,\ncomments), while simultaneously addressing multiple bias dimensions.\nAdditionally, we introduce a computationally efficient mean alignment\nalternative technique for practical real-time inference in large-scale systems.\nWe validate our method through online A\/B testing on two major video platforms:\nKuaishou Lite and Kuaishou. The results demonstrate significant improvements in\nuser engagement and retention, with \\textbf{cumulative lifts of 0.267\\% and\n0.115\\% in active days, and 1.102\\% and 0.131\\% in average app usage time},\nrespectively.

    "abstract":"In recent years, the nonlinear anomalous thermal Hall effect has attracted\nsubstantial attention. In this paper, we carry out a theoretical exploration of\nthe intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and Nernst effect that is induced by the\nthermal Berry connection polarizability. This effect is independent of the\nrelaxation time and can be present in antiferromagnets possessing PT symmetry.\nAdditionally, we put forward a second-order intrinsic Wiedemann-Franz law,\nwhich represents the ratio of the second-order intrinsic thermal conductivity\ncoefficient to the second-order intrinsic electrical conductivity coefficient .\nWhen analyzed within a four-band PT symmetric Dirac model, we observe that the\nsecond-order intrinsic thermal conductivity coefficient is linearly\nproportional to the second-order intrinsic electrical conductivity coefficient\n, and the second-order intrinsic Wiedemann-Franz law is characterized by the\nchemical potential $\\mu$ in the low-temperature regime. These findings provide\nsignificant implications for experimental verification.",

Despite recent advancements in the efficient and\nunified one-for-all scheme, challenges persist in accurately segmenting\nanomalies for further monitoring. Moreover, this problem is obscured by the\nwidely-used AUROC metric under imbalanced UAD settings. This motivates us to\nemphasize the significance of precise segmentation of anomaly pixels using pAP\nand DSC as metrics.

This\nprogress sets the stage for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which present new\ncomplexity and performance requirements challenges.

The review also discusses solution methods\nfor NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into\ndifferent categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and\nmachine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising\nfuture research directions in network optimization.

    "abstract":"In real-world scenarios, the number of training samples across classes\nusually subjects to a long-tailed distribution. The conventionally trained\nnetwork may achieve unexpected inferior performance on the rare class compared\nto the frequent class. Most previous works attempt to rectify the network bias\nfrom the data-level or from the classifier-level. Differently, in this paper,\nwe identify that the bias towards the frequent class may be encoded into\nfeatures, i.e., the rare-specific features which play a key role in\ndiscriminating the rare class are much weaker than the frequent-specific\nfeatures. Based on such an observation, we introduce a simple yet effective\napproach, normalizing the parameters of Batch Normalization (BN) layer to\nexplicitly rectify the feature bias. To achieve this end, we represent the\nWeight\/Bias parameters of a BN layer as a vector, normalize it into a unit one\nand multiply the unit vector by a scalar learnable parameter. Through\ndecoupling the direction and magnitude of parameters in BN layer to learn, the\nWeight\/Bias exhibits a more balanced distribution and thus the strength of\nfeatures becomes more even. Extensive experiments on various long-tailed\nrecognition benchmarks (i.e., CIFAR-10\/100-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist\n2018) show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts remarkably.\nThe code and checkpoints are available at https:\/\/github.com\/yuxiangbao\/NBN.",

    "title":"Universal Incremental Learning: Mitigating Confusion from Inter- and\n  Intra-task Distribution Randomness",
    "abstract":"Incremental learning (IL) aims to overcome catastrophic forgetting of\nprevious tasks while learning new ones. Existing IL methods make strong\nassumptions that the incoming task type will either only increases new classes\nor domains (i.e. Class IL, Domain IL), or increase by a static scale in a\nclass- and domain-agnostic manner (i.e. Versatile IL (VIL)), which greatly\nlimit their applicability in the unpredictable and dynamic wild. In this work,\nwe investigate $\\textbf{Universal Incremental Learning (UIL)}$, where a model\nneither knows which new classes or domains will increase along sequential\ntasks, nor the scale of the increments within each task. This uncertainty\nprevents the model from confidently learning knowledge from all task\ndistributions and symmetrically focusing on the diverse knowledge within each\ntask distribution. Consequently, UIL presents a more general and realistic IL\nscenario, making the model face confusion arising from inter-task and\nintra-task distribution randomness. To $\\textbf{Mi}$tigate both\n$\\textbf{Co}$nfusion, we propose a simple yet effective framework for UIL,\nnamed $\\textbf{MiCo}$. At the inter-task distribution level, we employ a\nmulti-objective learning scheme to enforce accurate and deterministic\npredictions, and its effectiveness is further enhanced by a direction\nrecalibration module that reduces conflicting gradients. Moreover, at the\nintra-task distribution level, we introduce a magnitude recalibration module to\nalleviate asymmetrical optimization towards imbalanced class distribution.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both the UIL\nscenario and the VIL scenario.

    "title":"Fluorescent Biomolecules Detectable in Near-Surface Ice on Europa",
    "abstract":"Europa, Jupiter's second Galilean moon, is believed to host a subsurface\nocean in contact with a rocky mantle, where hydrothermal activity may drive the\nsynthesis of organic molecules. Of these molecules, abiotic synthesis of\naromatic amino acids is unlikely, and their detection on Europa could be\nconsidered a biosignature. Fluorescence from aromatic amino acids, with\ncharacteristic emissions in the 200-400 nanometer wavelength range, can be\ninduced by a laser and may be detectable where ocean material has been\nrelatively recently emplaced on Europa's surface, as indicated by geologically\nyoung terrain and surface features. However, surface bombardment by charged\nparticles from the Jovian magnetosphere and solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation\ndegrades organic molecules, limiting their longevity. We model radiolysis and\nphotolysis of aromatic amino acids embedded in ice, showing dependencies on\nhemispheric and latitudinal patterns of charged particle bombardment and ice\nphase. We demonstrate that biosignatures contained within freshly deposited ice\nin high-latitude regions on the surface of Europa are detectable using\nlaser-induced UV fluorescence, even from an orbiting spacecraft.",

    "abstract":"Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the automated\nprocessing of lengthy documents even without supervised training on a\ntask-specific dataset. Yet, their zero-shot performance in complex tasks as\nopposed to straightforward information extraction tasks remains suboptimal. One\nfeasible approach for tasks with lengthy, complex input is to first summarize\nthe document and then apply supervised fine-tuning to the summary. However, the\nsummarization process inevitably results in some loss of information. In this\nstudy we present a method for processing the summaries of long documents aimed\nto capture different important aspects of the original document. We hypothesize\nthat LLM summaries generated with different aspect-oriented prompts contain\ndifferent \\textit{information signals}, and we propose methods to measure these\ndifferences. We introduce approaches to effectively integrate signals from\nthese different summaries for supervised training of transformer models. We\nvalidate our hypotheses on a high-impact task -- 30-day readmission prediction\nfrom a psychiatric discharge -- using real-world data from four hospitals, and\nshow that our proposed method increases the prediction performance for the\ncomplex task of predicting patient outcome.",

    "abstract":"The coupling between electronic nematic degrees of freedom and acoustic\nphonons is known to significantly alter the universality class of a nematic\nquantum critical point (QCP). While non-Fermi-liquid behaviour emerges in the\nabsence of lattice coupling, the inclusion of interactions with acoustic\nphonons results in observables such as heat capacity and single-particle\nscattering rate exhibiting only subleading non-analytic corrections to dominant\nFermi-liquid terms. In this work, we demonstrate that the elastocaloric effect\n(ECE) -- the adiabatic temperature change under varying strain -- and the\nthermal expansion deviate from this pattern. Despite lattice coupling weakening\nthe singularity of the ECE, it preserves a dominant non-Fermi-liquid\ntemperature dependence. By drawing analogies between nematic systems and\nfield-tuned altermagnets, we further show that similar responses are expected\nfor the ECE near altermagnetic QCPs. We classify the types of piezomagnetic\ncouplings and analyse the regimes arising from field-tuned magnetoelastic\ninteractions. Our findings are shown to be consistent with the scaling theory\nfor elastic quantum criticality and they further emphasize the suitability of\nthe ECE as a sensitive probe near QCPs.",

    "abstract":"We present data processing and verification of the Southern Twenty-centimetre\nAll-sky Polarization Survey (STAPS) conducted with Murriyang, the Parkes 64-m\ntelescope. The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range\nof 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with\nthe S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long\nazimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the\ndata processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in\nboth flux density scale (Jy\/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale\n(K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The\ntemperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS)\nhigh-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical\nObservatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common\nresolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8\nmK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to\n1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum\nat declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and\nRM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole\nSTAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact\nsources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel\ntemperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of\nextragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of\nthe flux density scale is less than 10%.

    "title":"Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of\n  LLMs for Java Code Snippets",
    "abstract":"Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often\nfound on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type\ninformation such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent\nstudies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code\nsnippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially\naffected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public\non GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs'\nstrong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere\nretrieval of ground truth from training data.\n  To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code\nsnippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a\nprogram synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for\ntype inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped\nsignificantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall.\nSecond, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly\ndegraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in\nunderstanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the\nminimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference\nprimarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly\ninfer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a\nreliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the\nsnippets.\n  Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from\ndata leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code\nsnippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed\nbenchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs\nfor type inference tasks.",

    "title":"Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair",
    "abstract":"Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as\nexpressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can\nexpress properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and\nresponsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism\nfor the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties.\nOur produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in\ntest-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside\nthe given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework\nbased on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis,\nwhich readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified\nnegation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties\ninto Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to\npass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism\nfor Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL).\nHowever, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for\nexpressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to\nstratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite\ncomputations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach\nachieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a\nreal-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and\n76.9%. Our approach repairs all detected bugs, which is not achieved by\nexisting tools.",

    "title":"Primordial Origin of Methane on Eris and Makemake Supported by D\/H\n  Ratios",
    "abstract":"Deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, is a key tracer of the formation of\nthe Solar System. Recent JWST observations have expanded the dataset of D\/H\nratios in methane on the KBOs Eris and Makemake, providing new insights into\ntheir origins. This study examines the elevated D\/H ratios in methane on these\nKBOs in the context of protosolar nebula dynamics and chemistry, and proposes a\nprimordial origin for the methane, in contrast to previous hypotheses\nsuggesting abiotic production by internal heating. A time-dependent disk model\ncoupled with a deuterium chemistry module was used to simulate the isotopic\nexchange between methane and hydrogen. Observational constraints, including the\nD\/H ratio measured in methane in comet 67P\/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, were used to\nrefine the primordial D\/H abundance. The simulations show that the observed D\/H\nratios in methane on Eris and Makemake are consistent with a primordial origin.\nThe results suggest that methane on these KBOs likely originates from the\nprotosolar nebula, similar to cometary methane, and was sequestered in solid\nform -- either as pure condensates or clathrates -- within their building\nblocks prior to accretion. These results provide a { simple} explanation for\nthe high D\/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake, without the need to invoke\ninternal production mechanisms.",

    "abstract":"Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of pure neutron matter is necessary\nfor interpreting multi-messenger observations of neutron stars. Reliable data\nanalyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the\nEOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions directly\nto the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively\nlarger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem\nfor each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as Auxiliary field diffusion\nMonte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron\nmatter EOS but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable\nfor the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ\nparametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of\nneutron matter, and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling\nconstants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include\nestimates of the EFT truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust\nuncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses.

    "abstract":"Many quantum communication protocols rely on the distribution of entanglement\nbetween the different participating parties. One example is quantum key\ndistribution (QKD), an application that has matured to commercial use in recent\nyears. However, difficulties remain, especially with noise resilience and\nchannel capacity in long-distance communication. One way to overcome these\nproblems is to use high-dimensional entanglement, which has been shown to be\nmore robust to noise and enables higher secret-key rates. It is therefore\nimportant to have access to certifiable high-dimensional entanglement sources\nto confidently implement these advanced QKD protocols. Here, we develop a\nmethod for certifying high-dimensional time-bin entanglement in fiber-loop\nsystems. In these systems, entanglement creation and detection can utilize the\nsame physical components, and the number of time bins, and thus the\nentanglement dimension, can be adapted without making physical changes to the\nsetup. Our certification method builds on previous proposals for the\ncertification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular,\nmeasurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to\nobtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and\nmultiphoton quantum states. Numerical simulations show that the method is\nrobust against typical experimental noise effects and works well even with\nlimited measurement statistics, thus establishing time-bin encoded photons as a\npromising platform for high-dimensional quantum-communication protocols.",

Despite their importance, the exact structure of these\nfields, particularly in galactic halos, remains unclear. Accurate descriptions\nare crucial for understanding the interaction between star formation and halo\nmagnetisation. By systematically analysing the polarisation patterns in halos\nof nearby galaxies, we aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between\ngalactic magnetic fields and star formation processes. We provide an analytical\ndescription of the observed X-shaped halos. Based on radio polarimetry data, we\nclassify the polarisation patterns of a sample of edge-on galaxies, by using a\nnewly introduced three-class system: disc dominated, small-scale, and X-shaped.\nWe then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified\nas X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other\nphysical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11\nout of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies\nclassified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected\nfor their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized\nHI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best\nfitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the\nX-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the\ninterplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the\ngalactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals\nthat most exhibit an X-shaped configuration, indicating a common magnetic field\nstructure in galactic halos. The introduced models capture the X-shaped\nmorphology and reveal the link between the X-shape's opening angle and star\nformation rate surface density.",

    "abstract":"This paper introduces a framework for capturing stochasticity of choice\nprobabilities in neural networks, derived from and fully consistent with the\nRandom Utility Maximization (RUM) theory, referred to as RUM-NN. Neural network\nmodels show remarkable performance compared with statistical models; however,\nthey are often criticized for their lack of transparency and interoperability.\nThe proposed RUM-NN is introduced in both linear and nonlinear structures. The\nlinear RUM-NN retains the interpretability and identifiability of traditional\neconometric discrete choice models while using neural network-based estimation\ntechniques. The nonlinear RUM-NN extends the model's flexibility and predictive\ncapabilities to capture nonlinear relationships between variables within\nutility functions. Additionally, the RUM-NN allows for the implementation of\nvarious parametric distributions for unobserved error components in the utility\nfunction and captures correlations among error terms. The performance of RUM-NN\nin parameter recovery and prediction accuracy is rigorously evaluated using\nsynthetic datasets through Monte Carlo experiments. Additionally, RUM-NN is\nevaluated on the Swissmetro and the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)\ndatasets with different sets of distribution assumptions for the error\ncomponent. The results demonstrate that RUM-NN under a linear utility structure\nand IID Gumbel error terms can replicate the performance of the Multinomial\nLogit (MNL) model, but relaxing those constraints leads to superior performance\nfor both Swissmetro and LPMC datasets. By introducing a novel estimation\napproach aligned with statistical theories, this study empowers econometricians\nto harness the advantages of neural network models.",

By this work, we\ninvestigated the CP violation in the cascade decay process $D^0(t_1) \\to \\pi^0\nK(t_2) \\to \\pi^0(\\pi^\\pm \\ell^\\mp \\nu)$. Our results indicate that the CP\nviolation induced by the interference of unmixed $D$-meson decay amplitudes\ndominates, with a peak value reaching $5 \\times 10^{-3}$. This is one order of\nmagnitude larger than the sub-leading contribution, namely the double-mixing CP\nviolation. Furthermore, the CP violation in the decay channel with the\nsemileptonic final state $\\pi^- \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell$ is one to two orders of\nmagnitude larger than that in the channel with $ \\pi^+ \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$.\nWe propose that the CP asymmetry of the combined two decay channels can be\nmeasured experimentally. The resulting value is approximately half of the CP\nviolation observed in the $\\pi^- \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell$ channel, with the dominant\ncontribution still reaching the order of $10^{-3}$.

    "abstract":"Motivated by the recent popularity of machine learning training services, we\nintroduce a contract design problem in which a provider sells a service that\nresults in an outcome of uncertain quality for the buyer. The seller has a set\nof actions that lead to different distributions over outcomes. We focus on a\nsetting in which the seller has the ability to commit to an action and the\nbuyer is free to accept or reject the outcome after seeing its realized\nquality. We propose a two-stage payment scheme where the seller designs a menu\nof contracts, each of which specifies an action, an upfront price and a vector\nof outcome-dependent usage prices. Upon selecting a contract, the buyer pays\nthe upfront price, and after observing the realized outcome, the buyer either\naccepts and pays the corresponding usage price, or rejects and is exempt from\nfurther payment. We show that this two-stage payment structure is necessary to\nmaximize profit: only upfront prices or only usage prices is insufficient. We\nthen study the computational complexity of computing a profit-maximizing menu\nin our model. While computing the exact maximum seller profit is NP-hard even\nfor two buyer types, we derive a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme\n(FPTAS) for the maximum profit for a constant number of buyer types. Finally,\nwe prove that in the single-parameter setting in which buyers' valuations are\nparametrized by a single real number that seller revenue can be maximized using\na menu consisting of a single contract.",

    "title":"Uncertainty-Aware Normal-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Surface\n  Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sequences",
    "abstract":"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive rendering performance in\nnovel view synthesis. However, its efficacy diminishes considerably in sparse\nimage sequences, where inherent data sparsity amplifies geometric uncertainty\nduring optimization. This often leads to convergence at suboptimal local\nminima, resulting in noticeable structural artifacts in the reconstructed\nscenes.To mitigate these issues, we propose Uncertainty-aware Normal-Guided\nGaussian Splatting (UNG-GS), a novel framework featuring an explicit Spatial\nUncertainty Field (SUF) to quantify geometric uncertainty within the 3DGS\npipeline. UNG-GS enables high-fidelity rendering and achieves high-precision\nreconstruction without relying on priors. Specifically, we first integrate\nGaussian-based probabilistic modeling into the training of 3DGS to optimize the\nSUF, providing the model with adaptive error tolerance. An uncertainty-aware\ndepth rendering strategy is then employed to weight depth contributions based\non the SUF, effectively reducing noise while preserving fine details.\nFurthermore, an uncertainty-guided normal refinement method adjusts the\ninfluence of neighboring depth values in normal estimation, promoting robust\nresults. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNG-GS significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in both sparse and dense sequences. The\ncode will be open-source.",

Among various bias issues, mitigating two predominant\nbiases is crucial in advancing fair and trustworthy AI: (1) ensuring neural\nnetworks yields even performance across demographic groups, and (2) ensuring\nalgorithmic decision-making does not rely on protected attributes. However,\nupon the investigation of \\pc papers in the relevant literature, we find that\nthere exists a persistent, extensive but under-explored confusion regarding\nthese two types of biases. Furthermore, the confusion has already significantly\nhampered the clarity of the community and subsequent development of debiasing\nmethodologies. Thus, in this work, we aim to restore clarity by providing two\nmathematical definitions for these two predominant biases and leveraging these\ndefinitions to unify a comprehensive list of papers. Next, we highlight the\ncommon phenomena and the possible reasons for the existing confusion. To\nalleviate the confusion, we provide extensive experiments on synthetic, census,\nand image datasets, to validate the distinct nature of these biases,\ndistinguish their different real-world manifestations, and evaluate the\neffectiveness of a comprehensive list of bias assessment metrics in assessing\nthe mitigation of these biases. Further, we compare these two types of biases\nfrom multiple dimensions including the underlying causes, debiasing methods,\nevaluation protocol, prevalent datasets, and future directions.

However, learning-based registration approaches lack\ngeneralizability across diverse clinical scenarios, requiring the laborious\ndevelopment of multiple isolated networks for specific registration tasks,\ne.g., inter-\/intra-subject registration or organ-specific alignment. % To\novercome this limitation, we propose \\textbf{UniReg}, the first interactive\nfoundation model for medical image registration, which combines the precision\nadvantages of task-specific learning methods with the generalization of\ntraditional optimization methods. Our key innovation is a unified framework for\ndiverse registration scenarios, achieved through a conditional deformation\nfield estimation within a unified registration model. This is realized through\na dynamic learning paradigm that explicitly encodes: (1) anatomical structure\npriors, (2) registration type constraints (inter\/intra-subject), and (3)\ninstance-specific features, enabling the generation of scenario-optimal\ndeformation fields. % Through comprehensive experiments encompassing $90$\nanatomical structures at different body regions, our UniReg model demonstrates\ncomparable performance with contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies while\nachieving ~50\\% reduction in required training iterations relative to the\nconventional learning-based paradigm.

    "abstract":"Roadside vision centric 3D object detection has received increasing attention\nin recent years. It expands the perception range of autonomous vehicles,\nenhances the road safety. Previous methods focused on predicting per-pixel\nheight rather than depth, making significant gains in roadside visual\nperception. While it is limited by the perspective property of near-large and\nfar-small on image features, making it difficult for network to understand real\ndimension of objects in the 3D world. BEV features and voxel features present\nthe real distribution of objects in 3D world compared to the image features.\nHowever, BEV features tend to lose details due to the lack of explicit height\ninformation, and voxel features are computationally expensive. Inspired by this\ninsight, an efficient framework learning height prediction in voxel features\nvia transformer is proposed, dubbed HeightFormer. It groups the voxel features\ninto local height sequences, and utilize attention mechanism to obtain height\ndistribution prediction. Subsequently, the local height sequences are\nreassembled to generate accurate 3D features. The proposed method is applied to\ntwo large-scale roadside benchmarks, DAIR-V2X-I and Rope3D. Extensive\nexperiments are performed and the HeightFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods in roadside vision centric 3D object detection task.",

    "abstract":"In task-oriented semantic communications, the transmitters are designed to\ndeliver task-related semantic information rather than every signal bit to\nreceivers, which alleviates the spectrum pressure by reducing network traffic\nloads. Effective semantic communications depend on the perfect alignment of\nshared knowledge between transmitters and receivers, however, the alignment of\nknowledge cannot always be guaranteed in practice. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel knowledge sharing-enabled task-oriented hybrid semantic and bit\ncommunications mechanism, where a mobile device (MD) can proactively share and\nupload the task-related mismatched knowledge to associated small base station\n(SBS). The traditional bit communications can be adopted as an aid to transmit\nthe rest data related to unshared mismatched knowledge to guarantee the\neffective execution of target tasks. Considering the heterogeneous transceivers\nin multi-cell networks, target task demands, and channel conditions, an\noptimization problem is formulated to maximize the generalized effective\nsemantic transmission rate of all MDs by jointly optimizing knowledge sharing,\nsemantic extraction ratio, and SBS association, while satisfying the semantic\naccuracy requirements and delay tolerances of MD target tasks. The formulated\nmixed integer nonlinear programming problem is decomposed into multiple\nsubproblems equivalently. An optimum algorithm is proposed and another\nefficient algorithm is further developed using hierarchical class partitioning\nand monotonic optimization.

    "title":"Conversational Concurrency with Dataspaces and Facets",
    "abstract":"Context: Developers have come to appreciate the simplicity of message-passing\nactors for concurrent programming tasks. The actor model of computation is easy\nto grasp; it is just a conversation among actors with a common goal.\nImportantly, it eliminates some basic pitfalls of the dominant shared-memory\nmodel, most critically data races.\n  Inquiry: A close look at real-world conversations suggests, however, that\nthey are not mere exchanges of messages. Participants must keep in mind\nconversational context, and participants joining late can and often must\nacquire some of this context. In addition, some settings call for engaging in\nseveral conversations in parallel; in others, participants conduct temporarily\nlimited sub-conversations to clarify a point. Existing actor code exhibits\ncomplex design patterns that get around the underlying limitations of the pure\nmessage-passing model.\n  Approach: These patterns suggest a number of elements involved in programming\nconversational computations. Translated into terms of language design, they\ncall for two kinds of facilities: (1) one for sharing conversational context\nand (2) another one for organizing individual actors around on-going\nconversations and their contexts.\n  Knowledge: This paper presents Syndicate, a language designed to directly\nsupport the programming of conversing actors. Beyond message passing, it\nsupplies (1) a dataspace, which allows actors to make public assertions, to\nwithdraw them, and to query what other actors have asserted; and (2) the facet\nnotation, which enables programmers to express individual actors as a\nreflection of the on-going conversations.\n  Grounding: A worked example introduces these concepts and illustrates\nconversational programming in Syndicate. A comparison with other research and\nindustrial concurrent languages demonstrates the unique support Syndicate\nprovides.\n  Importance: Syndicate advances concurrent actor programming with enhancements\nthat address some observed limitations of the underlying model. While\nmessage-passing simplifies concurrent programming, it falls short in handling\nthe complexities of actual computational conversations. By introducing a\ndataspace actor for sharing conversational context and the facet notation for\norganizing actors around ongoing conversations, Syndicate enables developers to\nnaturally express and manage the nuanced interactions often required in\nconcurrent systems. These innovations reduce the need for complex design\npatterns and provide unique support for building robust, context-aware\nconcurrent applications.",

Modeling small scales of motion is crucial for\nsaving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial\napplications. Here we attempt to model small scales of motion by creating\nclosures for a Shell model of turbulence, more specifically for Sabra. Shell\nmodels are infinite dimensional dynamical systems that retain most key\nproperties of Navier-Stokes equation, such as energy cascade and intermittency,\nwhile being computationally treatable. To account for Sabra's intermittent\nfluctuations we employ a set of scaling relations that recover a hidden\nsymmetry and leaves us with universal statistics across the inertial range. On\ndata from these rescaled variables we then adapt and apply two machine learning\ntools, a variational auto-encoder and sparse identification of non-linear\ndynamics. We estimate the data's densities and dynamics in order to then\ngenerate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we\nevolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the\ncutoff scale, closing the reduced model with data generated by the machine\nlearning tools. We compare statistics of our reduced models against a Sabra's\nfully resolved simulation to evaluate each closure's performances.

The novelty of our approach lies in two main\naspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from\nthe predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in\ndecision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the\ninterpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global\ninterpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty\nterm in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only\nimproves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint\non the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against\nseveral existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction. The\nsource code for the proposed method is available at:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/BugPredictor\/software-defect-prediction.git",

    "abstract":"We present a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm to detect plan\ninfeasibility in kinematic motion planning. Our method involves approximating\nthe robot's configuration space to a discrete space, where each degree of\nfreedom has a finite set of values. The obstacle region separates the free\nconfiguration space into different connected regions. For a path to exist\nbetween the start and goal configurations, they must lie in the same connected\nregion of the free space. Thus, to ascertain plan infeasibility, we merely need\nto sample adequate points from the obstacle region that isolate start and goal.\nAccordingly, we progressively construct the configuration space by sampling\nfrom the discretized space and updating the bitmap cells representing obstacle\nregions. Subsequently, we partition this partially built configuration space to\nidentify different connected components within it and assess the connectivity\nof the start and goal cells. We illustrate this methodology on five different\nscenarios with configuration spaces having up to 5 degree-of-freedom (DOF).",

While existing research predominantly\nfocuses on structured data formats, a substantial portion of semi-structured\ntextual data still requires ad-hoc and arduous manual profiling to extract and\ncomprehend its internal structures. In this work, we propose StructVizor, an\ninteractive profiling system that facilitates sensemaking and transformation of\nsemi-structured textual data. Our tool mainly addresses two challenges: a)\nextracting and visualizing the diverse structural patterns within data, such as\nhow information is organized or related, and b) enabling users to efficiently\nperform various wrangling operations on textual data. Through automatic data\nparsing and structure mining, StructVizor enables visual analytics of\nstructural patterns, while incorporating novel interactions to enable\nprofile-based data wrangling. A comparative user study involving 12\nparticipants demonstrates the system's usability and its effectiveness in\nsupporting exploratory data analysis and transformation tasks.",

    "abstract":"JWST observations, when combined with HST data, promise to improve age\nestimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from\nyoung cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation\nand evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the\nnearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED)\ntemplates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 {\\mu}m. These\npreliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within\nradii of 0.12\" to 0.67\" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC\n628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can\nbe differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we\nstudy, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust\nresponsible for the 3.3 {\\mu}m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr,\nconsistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the\nsurrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs\nwhich are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all\ncases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec\n(10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the\ncluster was triggered by its presence. The resulting age estimates from the\nempirical templates are compatible both with dynamical estimates based on CO\nsuperbubble expansion velocities, and the TODDLERS models which track spherical\nevolution of homogeneous gas clouds around young stellar clusters.",

    "title":"High-temperature measurements of acetylene VUV absorption cross sections\n  and application to warm exoplanet atmospheres",
    "abstract":"Most observed exoplanets have high equilibrium temperatures. Understanding\nthe chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires\nthe use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal\ndependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of\nmolecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to\nuncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to\nstudy experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of\nmolecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for\nuse in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured\nabsorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773\nK recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and\nsynchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical\nmodel, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot\nJupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of\nC2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115\nto 185 nm and rises sharply from 185 to 230 nm. The abundance profile of C2H2\ncalculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of\n40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at\n773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher\nin the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase\nin the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the\nabundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene\n(C2H4). We present the first experimental measurements of the VUV absorption\ncross sections of C2H2 at high temperatures. Similar studies of other major\nspecies are needed to improve our understanding of exoplanet atmospheres.",

Using added-value products of the Calar Alto\nVoid Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) and SDSS DR16 images, we examine\nthe effect of large-scale environments on the stellar mass-size relation. We\nanalyse the Petrosian R50 and R90 radii of approximately 140000 galaxies in\nvoids, filaments, and clusters, with a mass range of $10^{8.5} - 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$. We explore the relation in terms of galaxy morphology and star\nformation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type\nvoid galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser\nenvironments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the\nmass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope\ncompared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in\nfilaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type\ncluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\\star} \/ M_{\\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$\nare smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density\nenvironments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale\nenvironments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to\ngrow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size\ngrowth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced\nminor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter\nslope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a\ntrend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\\approx 10^{10.5}\nM_{\\odot}$, where minor mergers contribute to size growth. Conversely,\nlate-type quenched cluster galaxies are smaller due to environmental\ninteractions, with early infallers being most affected.",

    "abstract":"Localized receptive fields -- neurons that are selective for certain\ncontiguous spatiotemporal features of their input -- populate early sensory\nregions of the mammalian brain. Unsupervised learning algorithms that optimize\nexplicit sparsity or independence criteria replicate features of these\nlocalized receptive fields, but fail to explain directly how localization\narises through learning without efficient coding, as occurs in early layers of\ndeep neural networks and might occur in early sensory regions of biological\nsystems. We consider an alternative model in which localized receptive fields\nemerge without explicit top-down efficiency constraints -- a feedforward neural\nnetwork trained on a data model inspired by the structure of natural images.\nPrevious work identified the importance of non-Gaussian statistics to\nlocalization in this setting but left open questions about the mechanisms\ndriving dynamical emergence. We address these questions by deriving the\neffective learning dynamics for a single nonlinear neuron, making precise how\nhigher-order statistical properties of the input data drive emergent\nlocalization, and we demonstrate that the predictions of these effective\ndynamics extend to the many-neuron setting. Our analysis provides an\nalternative explanation for the ubiquity of localization as resulting from the\nnonlinear dynamics of learning in neural circuits.",

    "abstract":"Translating human intent into robot commands is crucial for the future of\nservice robots in an aging society. Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)\nsystems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly\ndue to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the\nchallenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that\ncombines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI\nsystem. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to\ngain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are\nestimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM)\nwith voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes,\nrobot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints\nare applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is\nevaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a\nUniversal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research\ncommunity and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.",

    "abstract":"Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the\nvulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While it has been extensively studied\nin discriminative models over the past few years, backdoor learning in\ndiffusion models (DMs) has recently attracted increasing attention, becoming a\nnew research hotspot. Although many different backdoor attack and defense\nmethods have been proposed for DMs, a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor\nlearning in DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct\nfair comparisons and thoroughly evaluate existing approaches, thus hindering\nfuture research progress. To address this issue, we propose BackdoorDM, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning in DMs. It\ncomprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense\nstrategies, and two helpful visualization analysis tools. We first\nsystematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified\nframework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor\ntarget types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models.\nThen, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and\npropose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Finally, we\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions.\nWe believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute\nto building a trustworthy DMs community.

    "title":"MVTokenFlow: High-quality 4D Content Generation using Multiview Token\n  Flow",
    "abstract":"In this paper, we present MVTokenFlow for high-quality 4D content creation\nfrom monocular videos. Recent advancements in generative models such as video\ndiffusion models and multiview diffusion models enable us to create videos or\n3D models. However, extending these generative models for dynamic 4D content\ncreation is still a challenging task that requires the generated content to be\nconsistent spatially and temporally. To address this challenge, MVTokenFlow\nutilizes the multiview diffusion model to generate multiview images on\ndifferent timesteps, which attains spatial consistency across different\nviewpoints and allows us to reconstruct a reasonable coarse 4D field. Then,\nMVTokenFlow further regenerates all the multiview images using the rendered 2D\nflows as guidance. The 2D flows effectively associate pixels from different\ntimesteps and improve the temporal consistency by reusing tokens in the\nregeneration process. Finally, the regenerated images are spatiotemporally\nconsistent and utilized to refine the coarse 4D field to get a high-quality 4D\nfield. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and show\nsignificantly improved quality than baseline methods.",

    "abstract":"The growing accessibility of diffusion models has revolutionized image\nediting but also raised significant concerns about unauthorized modifications,\nsuch as misinformation and plagiarism. Existing countermeasures largely rely on\nadversarial perturbations designed to disrupt diffusion model outputs. However,\nthese approaches are found to be easily neutralized by simple image\npreprocessing techniques, such as compression and noise addition. To address\nthis limitation, we propose GuardDoor, a novel and robust protection mechanism\nthat fosters collaboration between image owners and model providers.\nSpecifically, the model provider participating in the mechanism fine-tunes the\nimage encoder to embed a protective backdoor, allowing image owners to request\nthe attachment of imperceptible triggers to their images. When unauthorized\nusers attempt to edit these protected images with this diffusion model, the\nmodel produces meaningless outputs, reducing the risk of malicious image\nediting. Our method demonstrates enhanced robustness against image\npreprocessing operations and is scalable for large-scale deployment. This work\nunderscores the potential of cooperative frameworks between model providers and\nimage owners to safeguard digital content in the era of generative AI.",

    "title":"Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via DPO:\n  On-Policy Data Hold the Key",
    "abstract":"Hallucination remains a major challenge for Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention\nas a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from\nconstructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in\nresponses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data\nconstruction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We\nidentify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the\nconstructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.\nTheoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by\nthe presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference\npolicy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically\nsummarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address\nhallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment\n(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct\nhallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised\nresponses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO\nachieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:\n13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared\nto the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.

    "abstract":"Due to rich rheological properties, dispersions of attractive colloidal\nparticles are ubiquitous in industries. Specifically, upon experiencing a\nsudden reduction in shear rate, these dispersions may exhibit transient\nbehaviors such as thixotropy-where viscosity increases over time-and\nanti-thixotropy, characterized by an initial viscosity decrease before reaching\na steady state. While thixotropy has been described as a competition between\nstructure buildup and disruption, the mechanisms of anti-thixotropy remain\npoorly understood. Here, we investigate the anti-thixotropic dynamics of carbon\nblack particles dispersed in oil-a system known for exhibiting\nanti-thixotropy-through flow step-down experiments. Using a multi-technique\napproach combining rheology with velocimetry and structural characterizations,\nwe show that viscosity decrease results from a decrease in wall slip\nconcomitant to shear-induced structural rearrangements, indicating a transition\nfrom a dynamical network of fractal clusters into a network of loosely\nconnected dense agglomerates. Additionally, after a characteristic\nanti-thixotropic time $\\tau$, a steady flow is reached. This time $\\tau$\ndiverges with increasing shear rate at a critical value corresponding to a\nMason number of one, indicating that anti-thixotropy occurs only when colloidal\nattraction outweighs viscous forces. More precisely, we show that the\nstructural rearrangement underpinning the viscosity decrease is mediated by\nelastic stresses $\\sigma_e$, such that $\\tau \\propto \\sigma_e^{-3}$. Finally,\non long time scales, the steady state is linked to a microstructure with nearly\nzero yield stress, indicating a loss of flow memory. These findings provide a\nmechanism for anti-thixotropy and suggest pathways for controlling viscosity\nand yield stress in attractive colloidal dispersions.",

    "abstract":"The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has marked a paradigm shift in\nalloy design, moving away from traditional methods that prioritize a dominant\nbase metal enhanced by minor elements. HEAs instead incorporate multiple\nalloying elements with no single dominant component, broadening the scope of\nalloy design. This shift has led to the creation of diverse alloys with high\nentropy (AHEs) families, including high-entropy steels, superalloys, and\nintermetallics, each highlighting the need to consider additional factors such\nas stacking fault energy (SFE), lattice misfit, and anti-phase boundary energy\n(APBE) due to their significant influence on microstructure and performance.\nLeveraging multiple elements in alloying opens up promising possibilities for\ndeveloping new alloys from multi-component scrap and electronic waste, reducing\nreliance on critical metals and emphasizing the need for advanced data\ngeneration techniques. With the vast possibilities offered by these\nmulti-component feedstocks, modelling and Artificial Intelligence based tools\nare essential to efficiently explore and optimize new alloys, supporting\nsustainable progress in metallurgy.

These models embed nuclei-specific priors to outperform generic\narchitectures like U-Nets; however, they require large annotated datasets,\nwhich are often not available. Generative models (GANs, diffusion models) have\nbeen used to compensate for this by synthesizing training data. These two-stage\napproaches are computationally expensive, as first a generative model and then\na segmentation model has to be trained. We propose CyclePose, a hybrid\nframework integrating synthetic data generation and segmentation training.\nCyclePose builds on a CycleGAN architecture, which allows unpaired translation\nbetween microscopy images and segmentation masks. We embed a segmentation model\ninto CycleGAN and leverage a cycle consistency loss for self-supervision.\nWithout annotated data, CyclePose outperforms other weakly or unsupervised\nmethods on two public datasets.

    "abstract":"This paper addresses generalized category discovery (GCD), the task of\nclustering unlabeled data from potentially known or unknown categories with the\nhelp of labeled instances from each known category. Compared to traditional\nsemi-supervised learning, GCD is more challenging because unlabeled data could\nbe from novel categories not appearing in labeled data. Current\nstate-of-the-art methods typically learn a parametric classifier assisted by\nself-distillation. While being effective, these methods do not make use of\ncross-instance similarity to discover class-specific semantics which are\nessential for representation learning and category discovery. In this paper, we\nrevisit the association-based paradigm and propose a Prior-constrained\nAssociation Learning method to capture and learn the semantic relations within\ndata. In particular, the labeled data from known categories provides a unique\nprior for the association of unlabeled data. Unlike previous methods that only\nadopts the prior as a pre or post-clustering refinement, we fully incorporate\nthe prior into the association process, and let it constrain the association\ntowards a reliable grouping outcome. The estimated semantic groups are utilized\nthrough non-parametric prototypical contrast to enhance the representation\nlearning. A further combination of both parametric and non-parametric\nclassification complements each other and leads to a model that outperforms\nexisting methods by a significant margin. On multiple GCD benchmarks, we\nperform extensive experiments and validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",

Although this symmetry is ``spontaneously broken'' in the\nperturbative vacuum, it can be restored in the true confining vacuum of QCD.\nTherefore, a color confinement criterion is obtained as the condition of\nrestoration of the RGS, namely, disappearance of the massless Nambu-Goldstone\npole associated with this spontaneous breaking, provided that the color\nconfinement phase is a disordered phase where all internal symmetries remain\nunbroken. In the Lorenz gauge, indeed, it was shown by Hata that the\nrestoration condition is identical to the Kugo-Ojima color confinement\ncriterion, if the gauge transformation function $\\omega (x)$ for the residual\ngauge symmetry is taken to be linear in $x$.

In this work, we propose a novel method i.e. Adaptive\nAttribute Prototype Model (AAPM) for human action recognition, which captures\nrich action-relevant attribute information and strikes a balance between\naccuracy and robustness. Firstly, we introduce the Text-Constrain Module (TCM)\nto incorporate textual information from potential labels, and constrain the\nconstruction of different attributes prototype representations. In addition, we\nexplore the Attribute Assignment Method (AAM) to address the issue of training\nbias and increase robustness during the training process.Furthermore, we\nconstruct a new video dataset with attribute-based multi-label called\nMulti-Kinetics for evaluation, which contains various attribute labels (e.g.\naction, scene, object, etc.) related to human behavior. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our AAPM achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both\nattribute-based multi-label few-shot action recognition and single-label\nfew-shot action recognition.

Specifically, we examine\nscenarios where daycare centers have similar priorities over children, a common\ncharacteristic in real-world markets. Our analysis reveals that as the market\nsize approaches infinity, the likelihood of stable matchings existing converges\nto 1.\n  To facilitate our exploration, we refine an existing heuristic algorithm to\naddress a more rigorous stability concept, as the original one may fail to meet\nthis criterion.

    "abstract":"We present VPNeXt, a new and simple model for the Plain Vision Transformer\n(ViT). Unlike the many related studies that share the same homogeneous\nparadigms, VPNeXt offers a fresh perspective on dense representation based on\nViT. In more detail, the proposed VPNeXt addressed two concerns about the\nexisting paradigm: (1) Is it necessary to use a complex Transformer Mask\nDecoder architecture to obtain good representations? (2) Does the Plain ViT\nreally need to depend on the mock pyramid feature for upsampling? For (1), we\ninvestigated the potential underlying reasons that contributed to the\neffectiveness of the Transformer Decoder and introduced the Visual Context\nReplay (VCR) to achieve similar effects efficiently. For (2), we introduced the\nViTUp module. This module fully utilizes the previously overlooked ViT real\npyramid feature to achieve better upsampling results compared to the earlier\nmock pyramid feature. This represents the first instance of such functionality\nin the field of semantic segmentation for Plain ViT. We performed ablation\nstudies on related modules to verify their effectiveness gradually. We\nconducted relevant comparative experiments and visualizations to show that\nVPNeXt achieved state-of-the-art performance with a simple and effective\ndesign. Moreover, the proposed VPNeXt significantly exceeded the\nlong-established mIoU wall\/barrier of the VOC2012 dataset, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art by a large margin, which also stands as the largest\nimprovement since 2015.",

    "abstract":"Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities, called resonant drag instabilities. These instabilities have\npredominantly been studied for single grain sizes, in which case they are found\nto grow fast. Nonlinear simulations indicate that strong dust overdensities can\nform, aiding the formation of planetesimals. In reality, however, there is\ngoing to be a distribution of dust sizes, which potentially has important\nconsequences. We study two different resonant drag instabilities, the streaming\ninstability and the settling instability, taking into account a continuous\nspectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether these instabilities survive in\nthe polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the\nmonodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid in an\nunstratified shearing box to recover the streaming instability and, for\napproximate stratification, the settling instability, in all cases focusing on\nsmall dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the\nsingular perturbation of the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation due\nto the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the\nresonance. The contribution of the resonance to the integral can be negative,\nas in the case of the streaming instability, which as a result does not survive\nin the polydisperse regime, or positive, which is the case in the settling\ninstability. The latter therefore has a polydisperse counterpart, with growth\nrates that can be comparable to the monodisperse case. Wide size distributions\nin almost all cases remove the resonant nature of drag instabilities. This can\nlead to reduced growth, as is the case in large parts of parameter space for\nthe settling instability, or complete stabilisation, as is the case for the\nstreaming instability.",

However, matrices in emerging workloads are\nnot always dense, and sparse matrices where the vast majority of values are\nzeros are becoming more common. Existing matrix extensions and\nmicro-architectures cannot efficiently process highly sparse matrices due to\ntwo reasons: (1) wasted work when one or both input values are zero; and (2)\nincompatibility with sparse matrix formats. This work proposes SparseZipper\nthat minimally modifies existing matrix extensions and systolic-array-based\nmicro-architectures specialized for dense-dense GEMM to accelerate\nsparse-sparse GEMM operating on highly sparse matrices with unstructured\nsparsity structures. Our performance evaluation shows SparseZipper achieves\n5.98x and 2.61x speedup over a scalar hash-based implementation of SpGEMM and a\nstate-of-the-art vectorized SpGEMM version, respectively.

To lower costs, maximizing the request batch size\nby managing GPU memory efficiently is crucial. While PagedAttention has\nrecently been proposed to improve the efficiency of memory management, we find\nthat the growing heterogeneity in the embeddings dimensions, attention, and\naccess patterns of modern LLM architectures introduces new challenges for\nmemory allocation.\n  In this paper, we present Jenga, a novel memory allocation framework for\nheterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1)\nminimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes,\nand (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the\nspecific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level\nmemory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes\nto optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching\nlogic to enhance memory reuse.\n  We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and\nevaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations.

    "abstract":"Existing methods for simulating individual identities often oversimplify\nhuman complexity, which may lead to incomplete or flattened representations. To\naddress this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing\nauthentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional\nself-concept. SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S),\nPersonal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing\ndistinct yet interconnected aspects of identity. To evaluate SPeCtrum's\neffectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human\nevaluations. Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that\nPersonal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily\nroutines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity\n(S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC\ncombination. In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals\nfound that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept\nrepresentation than C alone. Our findings suggest that while C alone may\nsuffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the\nauthenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation. Overall,\nSPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents,\nenabling more personalized human-AI interactions and improving the realism of\nsimulation-based behavioral studies.",

    "abstract":"Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising approach to reducing the\nstorage and computational requirements of large language models (LLMs) without\nadditional training cost. Recent PTQ studies have primarily focused on\nquantizing only weights to sub-8-bits while maintaining activations at 8-bits\nor higher. Accurate sub-8-bit quantization for both weights and activations\nwithout relying on quantization-aware training remains a significant challenge.\nWe propose a novel quantization method called block clustered quantization\n(BCQ) wherein each operand tensor is decomposed into blocks (a block is a group\nof contiguous scalars), blocks are clustered based on their statistics, and a\ndedicated optimal quantization codebook is designed for each cluster. As a\nspecific embodiment of this approach, we propose a PTQ algorithm called\nLocally-Optimal BCQ (LO-BCQ) that iterates between the steps of block\nclustering and codebook design to greedily minimize the quantization mean\nsquared error. When weight and activation scalars are encoded to W4A4 format\n(with 0.5-bits of overhead for storing scaling factors and codebook selectors),\nwe advance the current state-of-the-art by demonstrating <1% loss in inference\naccuracy across several LLMs and downstream tasks.",

This study, using six years (2018-2024) of daily $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ data,\ninvestigates the seasonal characteristics of the distributions of\n$\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations across eleven Indian cities, selected from\ndifferent regions of the country. We find that, while each city has its own\nunique seasonal patterns, all of them show a universal exponential decay in the\ntail of the $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distribution for all the seasons. However, the\ndecay rates of this tail vary across cities, highlighting regional and seasonal\ndisparities in pollution levels. To quantitatively characterize the {\\it\nrandomness} of the seasonal $\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration distributions, we\ncompute Shannon entropy, a key information theoretic measure. This allows for\nclassifying cities into different groups, according to the level of randomness\nobserved in their seasonal distributions. To further explore the inter-city\nrelationships, we employ Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), a symmetric measure\nof relative entropy, to quantitatively assess the degree of similarity in the\n$\\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distributions among different cities. Remarkably, we find\nthat several cities show very similar distributions in the winter months, which\nhelps us to categories them into several groups.

This allows for more exact solutions, which make\ncontact with previous soliton literature. We also find bounded solutions, in\ncontrast to all known previous examples. Our results may be useful for the\nstudy of non-perturbative aspects of the double copy between gauge theories and\ngravity. We also speculate as to their possible practical applications.",

    "abstract":"This paper examines games with strategic complements or substitutes and\nincomplete information, where players are uncertain about the opponents'\nparameters. We assume that the players' beliefs about the opponent's parameters\nare selected from some given set of beliefs. One extreme is the case where\nthese sets only contain a single belief, representing a scenario where the\nplayers' actual beliefs about the parameters are commonly known among the\nplayers. Another extreme is the situation where these sets contain all possible\nbeliefs, representing a scenario where the players have no information about\nthe opponents' beliefs about parameters. But we also allow for intermediate\ncases, where these sets contain some, but not all, possible beliefs about the\nparameters. We introduce an assumption of weakly increasing differences that\ntakes both the choice belief and parameter belief of a player into account.\nUnder this assumption, we demonstrate that greater choice-parameter beliefs\nleads to greater optimal choices. Moreover, we show that the greatest and least\npoint rationalizable choice of a player is increasing in their parameter, and\nthese can be determined through an iterative procedure. In each round of the\niterative procedure, the lowest surviving choice is optimal for the lowest\nchoice-parameter belief, while the greatest surviving choice is optimal for the\nhighest choice-parameter belief.",

    "abstract":"In this work, we present a simple, uniform, and elegant solution to the\nproblem, with stunning practical effectiveness and application to virtually any\nDatalog-based analysis. The approach consists of leveraging the choice\nconstruct, supported natively in modern Datalog engines like Souffl\\'e. The\nchoice construct allows the definition of functional dependencies in a relation\nand has been used in the past for expressing worklist algorithms. We show a\nnear-universal construction that allows the choice construct to flexibly limit\nevaluation of predicates. The technique is applicable to practically any\nanalysis architecture imaginable, since it adaptively prunes evaluation results\nwhen a (programmer-controlled) projection of a relation exceeds a desired\ncardinality. We apply the technique to probably the largest, pre-existing\nDatalog analysis frameworks in existence: Doop (for Java bytecode) and the main\nclient analyses from the Gigahorse framework (for Ethereum smart contracts).\nWithout needing to understand the existing analysis logic and with minimal,\nlocal-only changes, the performance of each framework increases dramatically,\nby over 20x for the hardest inputs, with near-negligible sacrifice in\ncompleteness.",

    "abstract":"Dust grains in protoplanetary disks are the building blocks of planets.\nInvestigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is\ncrucial for understanding the planet formation process. The PDS 70 disk is so\nfar the only protoplanetary disk with concrete evidence for the presence of\nyoung planets. Mid-infrared spectra were obtained for PDS 70 by the Infrared\nSpectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) and the Mid-Infrared\nInstrument (MIRI) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2007 and 2022,\nrespectively. In this work, we investigate the dust mineralogy through a\ndetailed decomposition of the observed mid-infrared spectra. The results show\nthat both the dust size and crystallinity increased by a factor of about two\nduring the two epochs of observation, indicating evident dust processing in the\nterrestrial planet-forming region of the PDS 70 disk. The dust size (~0.8\nmicron) and crystallinity (~6%) in the PDS 70 disk are similar to those of\nother disks, which implies that the two nascent planets, PDS 70b and PDS 70c\nlocated at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant\nimpact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at\nwavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST\/MIRI are only ~60% of those\nobtained by Spitzer\/IRS. Based on self-consistent radiative transfer modeling,\nwe found that such a strong variability in mid-infrared fluxes can be produced\nby adjustments to the dust density distribution and structure of the inner disk\nprobably induced by planet-disk interaction.",

    "abstract":"Accelerated MRI involves collecting partial k-space measurements to reduce\nacquisition time, patient discomfort, and motion artifacts, and typically uses\nregular undersampling patterns or hand-designed schemes. Recent works have\nstudied population-adaptive sampling patterns that are learned from a group of\npatients (or scans) based on population-specific metrics. However, such a\ngeneral sampling pattern can be sub-optimal for any specific scan since it may\nlack scan or slice adaptive details. To overcome this issue, we propose a\nframework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns\nand a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set. We use an\nalternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and reconstruction\nmodel where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline\noptimization of scan-adaptive k-space sampling patterns for each example in the\ntraining set. A nearest neighbor search is then used to select the\nscan-adaptive sampling pattern at test time from initially acquired\nlow-frequency k-space information. We applied the proposed framework (dubbed\nSUNO) to the fastMRI multi-coil knee and brain datasets, demonstrating improved\nperformance over currently used undersampling patterns at both 4x and 8x\nacceleration factors in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics.\nThe code for the proposed framework is available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/sidgautam95\/adaptive-sampling-mri-suno.",

However, this disaggregation introduces complexities in system\nintegration and network management, as components are often sourced from\ndifferent vendors. In addition, the operators who are relying on open source\nand virtualized components -- which are deployed on commodity hardware --\nrequire additional resilient solutions as O-RAN deployments suffer from the\nrisk of failures at multiple levels including infrastructure, platform, and RAN\nlevels. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FALCON, a fault\nprediction framework for O-RAN, which leverages infrastructure-, platform-, and\nRAN-level telemetry to predict faults in virtualized O-RAN deployments. By\naggregating and analyzing metrics from various components at different levels\nusing AI\/ML models, the FALCON framework enables proactive fault management,\nproviding operators with actionable insights to implement timely preventive\nmeasures. The FALCON framework, using a Random Forest classifier, outperforms\ntwo other classifiers on the predicted telemetry, achieving an average accuracy\nand F1-score of more than 98%.",

Here,\nwe contribute Chartist, a computational model that simulates how users move\ntheir eyes to extract information from the chart in order to perform analysis\ntasks, including value retrieval, filtering, and finding extremes. The novel\ncontribution lies in a two-level hierarchical control architecture. At the high\nlevel, the model uses LLMs to comprehend the information gained so far and\napplies this representation to select a goal for the lower-level controllers,\nwhich, in turn, move the eyes in accordance with a sampling policy learned via\nreinforcement learning. The model is capable of predicting human-like\ntask-driven scanpaths across various tasks. It can be applied in fields such as\nexplainable AI, visualization design evaluation, and optimization.

    "abstract":"We present distances to ten supernova (SN) host galaxies determined via the\nred giant branch tip (TRGB) using JWST\/NIRCAM and the F115W, F356W, and F444W\nbandpasses. Our analysis, including photometric catalog cleaning, adoption of\ndisk light profiles, TRGB color slope estimation, and a novel technique for\nidentifying the infrared TRGB, was conducted blinded. The new F115W TRGB\ndistances agree well with our previously derived HST TRGB distances, differing\nby only 1 percent on average and 4 percent on a per-galaxy basis. The\ncolor-corrected F115W TRGB is therefore equally precise a method of distance\nmeasurement as, and offers unique advantages over, its color-insensitive,\nI-band counterpart. Using these distances, we update the absolute calibrations\nof eleven calibrator SNe, yielding 68.4 < H0 < 69.6 km\/s\/Mpc depending on which\nof four sets of SN magnitudes are used. We expand the sample of calibrator SNe\nto 24 by combining with HST TRGB distances. Doing so increases our H0 estimate\nbased on the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP-II) by 0.8 km\/s\/Mpc (1.4 sigma)\ndemonstrating that our JWST H0 based on 11 SNe is not significantly biased\ntoward lower values. In contrast, the Pantheon+ calibration shifts higher by +2\nkm\/s\/Mpc (3.1 sigma), a significantly larger increase than seen in both the CSP\nand the Pantheon team's own SuperCal analysis. More JWST observations of the\nTRGB as well as independent analyses of low-redshift SNe are needed to continue\nunraveling the true nature of the Hubble Tension.",

This paper investigates the joint design\nof the radar receive filter and dual-functional transmit waveform for the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system. While optimizing the mean\nsquare error (MSE) of the radar receive spatial response and maximizing the\nachievable rate at the communication receiver, besides the constraints of\nfull-power radar receiving filter and unimodular transmit sequence, we control\nthe maximum range sidelobe level, which is often overlooked in existing ISAC\nwaveform design literature, for better radar imaging performance. To solve the\nformulated optimization problem with convex and nonconvex constraints, we\npropose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm. For each\nsubproblem in the proposed inexact ALM algorithm, we custom-design a block\nsuccessive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) scheme with closed-form solutions\nfor all blocks of variable to enhance the computational efficiency. Convergence\nanalysis shows that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to provide a\nstationary and feasible solution.

In this article, we demonstrate that turbulence in the cosmic\nbaryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial\ndistribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the universe.\nFirst, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in\nlow-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon\nfractions, while prevent the inflow of the gas in high-density regions, leading\nto low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal\nenergy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially\nreached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in\na state of fully-developed turbulence within this redshift range. Due to\nturbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is\nheated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas.",

    "abstract":"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D\nrepresentation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage\nrequirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit\nthe 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application\ncalls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and\nentropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely\nunexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned\nimage compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra\ncorrelation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work,\ntermed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their\nrate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented\naccording to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to\ncapture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial\nautoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving\nas the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to\nleverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our\nCAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively\nskips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact\non the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good\nrate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art\ncompression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.",

    "abstract":"For offshore structures like wind turbines, subsea infrastructure, pipelines,\nand cables, it is crucial to quantify the properties of the seabed sediments at\na proposed site. However, data collection offshore is costly, so analysis of\nthe seabed sediments must be made from measurements that are spatially sparse.\nAdding to this challenge, the structure of the seabed sediments exhibits both\nnonstationarity and anisotropy. To address these issues, we propose GeoWarp, a\nhierarchical spatial statistical modeling framework for inferring the 3-D\ngeotechnical properties of subsea sediments. GeoWarp decomposes the seabed\nproperties into a region-wide vertical mean profile (modeled using B-splines),\nand a nonstationary 3-D spatial Gaussian process. Process nonstationarity and\nanisotropy are accommodated by warping space in three dimensions and by\nallowing the process variance to change with depth. We apply GeoWarp to\nmeasurements of the seabed made using cone penetrometer tests (CPTs) at six\nsites on the North West Shelf of Australia. We show that GeoWarp captures the\ncomplex spatial distribution of the sediment properties, and produces realistic\n3-D simulations suitable for downstream engineering analyses. Through\ncross-validation, we show that GeoWarp has predictive performance superior to\nother state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its value as a tool in offshore\ngeotechnical engineering.",

    "abstract":"Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on\none or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target\ndomains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical\nrelevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on\ndiscriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable\nfeature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate\nshortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose\na novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a\ncorrelation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method\nintegrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained\ndiffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By\nincorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model\nwith a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark\nknowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process.\nSimultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through\nthe conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the\ngeneralization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both\nsingle-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into\nits robustness. Codes will be available at https:\/\/github.com\/RikoLi\/DCAC.",

    "abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel Left-Prompt-Guided (LPG) paradigm to\naddress a diverse range of reference-based vision tasks. Inspired by the human\ncreative process, we reformulate these tasks using a left-right stitching\nformulation to construct contextual input. Building upon this foundation, we\npropose AnyRefill, an extension of LeftRefill, that effectively adapts\nText-to-Image (T2I) models to various vision tasks. AnyRefill leverages the\ninpainting priors of advanced T2I model based on the Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture, and incorporates flexible components to enhance its\ncapabilities. By combining task-specific LoRAs with the stitching input,\nAnyRefill unlocks its potential across diverse tasks, including conditional\ngeneration, visual perception, and image editing, without requiring additional\nvisual encoders. Meanwhile, AnyRefill exhibits remarkable data efficiency,\nrequiring minimal task-specific fine-tuning while maintaining high generative\nperformance. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that AnyRefill\noutperforms other image condition injection methods and achieves competitive\nresults compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods. Notably, AnyRefill\ndelivers results comparable to advanced commercial tools, such as IC-Light and\nSeedEdit, even in challenging scenarios. Comprehensive experiments and ablation\nstudies across versatile tasks validate the strong generation of the proposed\nsimple yet effective LPG formulation, establishing AnyRefill as a unified,\nhighly data-efficient solution for reference-based vision tasks.",

    "abstract":"We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from\nthe X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black\nhole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the\nX-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to\nindirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole\nhorizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between\nX-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those\nthat first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous\nreverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software\npackage. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment\nof the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to\ndistance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate\nvariability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona.\nWe fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable\nvalues of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The\nmodels both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their\ntreatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return\ndifferent mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future\nreverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to\nconstrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised\nvia Bayesian priors.",

    "abstract":"Quantum code surgery is a flexible and low overhead technique for performing\nlogical measurements on quantum error-correcting codes, which generalises\nlattice surgery. In this work, we present a code surgery scheme, applicable to\nany Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) code, that\nfault-tolerantly measures many logical Pauli operators in parallel. For a\ncollection of logically disjoint Pauli product measurements supported on $t$\nlogical qubits, our scheme uses $O\\big(t \\omega (\\log t + \\log^3\\omega)\\big)$\nancilla qubits, where $\\omega \\geq d$ is the maximum weight of the single\nlogical Pauli representatives involved in the measurements, and $d$ is the code\ndistance. This is all done in time $O(d)$ independent of $t$. Our proposed\nscheme preserves both the LDPC property and the fault-distance of the original\ncode, without requiring ancillary logical codeblocks which may be costly to\nprepare. This addresses a shortcoming of several recently introduced surgery\nschemes which can only be applied to measure a limited number of logical\noperators in parallel if they overlap on data qubits.",

Inspired by the plastic surgery\nhypothesis, AG-RAG attempts to combine relevant unit tests and advanced\npre-trained language models (PLMs) with retrieval-augmented fine-tuning. AG-RAG\nbuilds a dense retriever to search for relevant test-assert pairs (TAPs) with\nsemantic matching and a retrieval-augmented generator to synthesize accurate\nassertions with the focal-test and retrieved TAPs as input. Besides, AG-RAG\nleverages a code-aware language model CodeT5 as the cornerstone to facilitate\nboth assertion retrieval and generation tasks. Furthermore, the retriever is\noptimized in conjunction with the generator as a whole pipeline with a joint\ntraining strategy. This unified design fully adapts both components\nspecifically for retrieving more useful TAPs, thereby generating accurate\nassertions. We extensively evaluate AG-RAG against six state-of-the-art AG\napproaches on two benchmarks and three metrics. Experimental results show that\nAG-RAG significantly outperforms previous AG approaches on all benchmarks and\nmetrics, e.g., improving the most recent baseline EditAS by 20.82% and 26.98%\nin terms of accuracy. AG-RAG also correctly generates 1739 and 2866 unique\nassertions that all baselines fail to generate, 3.45X and 9.20X more than\nEditAS.",

    "abstract":"Existing adaptation techniques typically require architectural modifications\nor added parameters, leading to high computational costs and complexity. We\nintroduce Attention Projection Layer Adaptation (APLA), a simple approach to\nadapt vision transformers (ViTs) without altering the architecture or adding\nparameters. Through a systematic analysis, we find that the layer immediately\nafter the attention mechanism is crucial for adaptation. By updating only this\nprojection layer, or even just a random subset of this layer's weights, APLA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing GPU memory usage by up to\n52.63% and training time by up to 43.0%, with no extra cost at inference.\nAcross 46 datasets covering a variety of tasks including scene classification,\nmedical imaging, satellite imaging, and fine-grained classification, APLA\nconsistently outperforms 17 other leading adaptation methods, including full\nfine-tuning, on classification, segmentation, and detection tasks.

Recent\nphotometric surveys from the Gaia mission, allowing observation of asteroids\nwith long spin periods (for example $\\geq 24$h), found an excessive group of\nslow rotators and a gap separating them from faster rotators, which is\nunexplained by current theories.

By\ndynamically inferring local blurring kernels through a trained convolutional\nneural network (CNN), DDConv captures complex tissue interfaces more accurately\nthan prior methods.

Comparisons\nwith a state-of-the-art, tissue-dependent correction confirm the advantages of\nDDConv in recovering higher-resolution details in heterogeneous regions,\nincluding bone-soft tissue and lung-soft tissue boundaries. Experiments across\ndigital phantoms, MC-simulated data, and patient scans verify that DDConv\nremains clinically practical through GPU-accelerated convolutions, offering\nnear-MC accuracy while significantly reducing computation times.

    "abstract":"We analyze correlations between density fluctuations and between current\nfluctuations in a one-dimensional driven lattice gas with repulsive\nnearest-neighbor interaction and in single-file Brownian motion of hard spheres\ndragged across a cosine potential with constant force. By extensive kinetic\nMonte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations we show that density and current\ncorrelation functions in nonequilibrium steady states follow the scaling\nbehavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In a coordinate\nframe comoving with the collective particle velocity, the current correlation\nfunction decays as $\\sim -t^{-4\/3}$ with time $t$. Density fluctuations spread\nsuperdiffusively as $\\sim t^{2\/3}$ at long times and their spatio-temporal\nbehavior is well described by the KPZ scaling function. In the absence of the\ncosine potential, the correlation functions in the system of dragged hard\nspheres show scaling behavior according to the Edwards-Wilkinson universality\nclass. In the coordinate frame comoving with the mean particle velocity, they\nbehave as in equilibrium, with current correlations decaying as $\\sim\n-t^{-3\/2}$ and density fluctuations spreading diffusively as $\\sim t^{1\/2}$.",

    "abstract":"In order to deeply understand the capability of pretrained language models in\ntext generation and conduct a diagnostic evaluation, we propose TGEA, an\nerror-annotated dataset with multiple benchmark tasks for text generation from\npretrained language models (PLMs). We use carefully selected prompt words to\nguide GPT-2 to generate candidate sentences, from which we select 47K for error\nannotation. Crowdsourced workers manually check each of these sentences and\ndetect 12k erroneous sentences. We create an error taxonomy to cover 24 types\nof errors occurring in these erroneous sentences according to the nature of\nerrors with respect to linguistics and knowledge (eg, common sense). For each\nerroneous span in PLM-generated sentences, we also detect another span that is\nclosely associated with it. Each error is hence manually labeled with\ncomprehensive annotations, including the span of the error, the associated\nspan, minimal correction to the error, the type of the error, and rationale\nbehind the error. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a\ndetailed description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis\nof the dataset. This is the first dataset with comprehensive annotations for\nPLM-generated texts, which facilitates the diagnostic evaluation of PLM-based\ntext generation. Furthermore, we use TGEA as a benchmark dataset and propose a\nseries of automatic diagnosis tasks, including error detection, error type\nclassification, associated span detection, error rationale generation, to\nfurther promote future study on the automatic error detection and correction on\ntexts generated by pretrained language models.",

    "abstract":"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a useful tool for uncovering\nhuman-interpretable features in the activations of large language models\n(LLMs). While some expect SAEs to find the true underlying features used by a\nmodel, our research shows that SAEs trained on the same model and data,\ndiffering only in the random seed used to initialize their weights, identify\ndifferent sets of features. For example, in an SAE with 131K latents trained on\na feedforward network in Llama 3 8B, only 30% of the features were shared\nacross different seeds. We observed this phenomenon across multiple layers of\nthree different LLMs, two datasets, and several SAE architectures. While ReLU\nSAEs trained with the L1 sparsity loss showed greater stability across seeds,\nSAEs using the state-of-the-art TopK activation function were more\nseed-dependent, even when controlling for the level of sparsity. Our results\nsuggest that the set of features uncovered by an SAE should be viewed as a\npragmatically useful decomposition of activation space, rather than an\nexhaustive and universal list of features \"truly used\" by the model.",

While natural language processing (NLP) offers\npromising tools for studying this phenomenon, current research lacks cohesion,\nemploying discordant datasets and tasks that examine isolated aspects of moral\nreasoning. We bridge this gap with UniMoral, a unified dataset integrating\npsychologically grounded and social-media-derived moral dilemmas annotated with\nlabels for action choices, ethical principles, contributing factors, and\nconsequences, alongside annotators' moral and cultural profiles. Recognizing\nthe cultural relativity of moral reasoning, UniMoral spans six languages,\nArabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, capturing diverse\nsocio-cultural contexts. We demonstrate UniMoral's utility through a benchmark\nevaluations of three large language models (LLMs) across four tasks: action\nprediction, moral typology classification, factor attribution analysis, and\nconsequence generation. Key findings reveal that while implicitly embedded\nmoral contexts enhance the moral reasoning capability of LLMs, there remains a\ncritical need for increasingly specialized approaches to further advance moral\nreasoning in these models.",

    "abstract":"[Abridged] Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies have proven to be unique\nenvironments for studying galaxy interactions. We propose a detailed analysis\nof the galaxy evolution to disentangle the relationship between the two\nfirst-ranked galaxies in CGs throughout their history as a function of the\nassembly channels of their hosts. Our study was performed from a\nsemi-analytical point of view, using more than 20000 CGs. We based our analysis\non studying the first- (1R) and second-ranked (2R) galaxies in CGs, where the\nranking is determined using the galaxy stellar mass. The 1R galaxies have\nsignificantly reduced their star-forming capacity over time, reaching a\nquenching stage and often becoming bulge-dominated or elliptical. Notably, this\ntransformation occurred earlier for 1R galaxies in early-formed CGs (around 5\nto 8 Gyrs ago), while those in recently-formed CGs experienced this change more\nrecently (around 2 to 3 Gyrs ago). The analysis of the time evolution of a\nvariant of the Tremaine & Richstone statistics showed that the 1R galaxy in\nearly-formed CGs began to stand out for its dominant properties around 6 Gyrs\nago, almost 5 Gyrs earlier than the 1R inhabiting recently formed CGs. We\nobserved that a large majority of the 1R galaxies have experienced at least one\nmajor merger event during their life, while we observed this only for a third\nof 2R galaxies. The 1R galaxies can also display several of these events and\nmost of their last major merger events can be described as the addition of a\nprogenitor that is the second most massive galaxy in their surroundings at the\ntime of the merger. We find that the semi-analytical framework explored in this\nwork describes a scenario where galaxy mergers are the main driving force in\nshaping the properties of the 1R galaxies in CGs. We note that this scenario is\nespecially intensive when those galaxies inhabit CGs that had formed early on.",

    "abstract":"Selecting high-quality training data from a larger pool is a crucial step\nwhen instruction-tuning language models, as carefully curated datasets often\nproduce models that outperform those trained on much larger, noisier datasets.\nAutomated data selection approaches for instruction-tuning are typically tested\nby selecting small datasets (roughly 10k samples) from small pools (100-200k\nsamples). However, popular deployed instruction-tuned models often train on\nhundreds of thousands to millions of samples, subsampled from even larger data\npools. We present a systematic study of how well data selection methods scale\nto these settings, selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M\nsamples and evaluating across 7 diverse tasks. We show that many recently\nproposed methods fall short of random selection in this setting (while using\nmore compute), and even decline in performance when given access to larger\npools of data to select over. However, we find that a variant of\nrepresentation-based data selection (RDS+), which uses weighted mean pooling of\npretrained LM hidden states, consistently outperforms more complex methods\nacross all settings tested -- all whilst being more compute-efficient.

We further demonstrate that\ncorrelations between sensor modalities reduce the worst-case entropy of using\nmultiple sensors by up to approx. 75% compared to average-case Shannon entropy.\nThis brings joint min-entropy well below 10 bits in many cases and, in the best\ncase, yielding only approx. 24 bits of min-entropy when combining 20 sensor\nmodalities. These results call into question the widely held assumption that\nadding more sensors inherently yields higher security.

These\nparticles are of great importance during thermomechanical treatments, as they\nproduce deviations from the microstructural evolution that the alloy produces\nin the absence of particles. This phenomenon, well-known as Smith-Zener\npinning, is widely used by metallurgists to control the grain size during the\nmetal forming process of many alloys. Predictive tools are then needed to\naccurately model this phenomenon. This article introduces a new methodology for\nthe simulation of microstructural evolutions subjected to the presence of\nsecond phase particles. The methodology employs a Lagrangian 2D front-tracking\nmethodology, while the particles are modeled using discretized circular shapes\nor pinning nodes. The evolution of the particles can be considered and modeled\nusing a constant velocity of particle shrinking. This approach has the\nadvantages of improving the limited description made of the phenomenon in\nvertex approaches, to be usable for a wide range of second-phase particle sizes\nand to improve calculation times compared to front-capturing type approaches.",

    "abstract":"Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ has gained attention in the condensed matter community for its\npotential to be exfoliated into thin films with ferromagnetic (FM) order,\nthanks to its van der Waals layered structure and significant intrinsic\nanomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we analyze the electronic\nstructure and show that, contrary to prior claims, the bulk of the AHC cannot\narise from gapped nodal lines. By studying the material's symmetry properties,\nboth with and without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and across paramagnetic and FM\nphases, we find that Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ hosts mirror-symmetry-protected nodal\nlines, which support surface drumhead states. Additionally, we identify three\nkey sources of AHC: nodal lines in the paramagnetic phase gapped by the FM\norder, Weyl points within specific energy ranges, and gaps between spin-up and\nspin-down bands caused by SOC. Finally, our calculations suggest that electron\ndoping could increase the AHC up to four times compared to its value at the\ncomputed Fermi level.",

This situation occurs\nwhen large domains are covered by multiple non-simultaneous measurements and\nyet the large-scale flow field organization is to be captured. The proposed\nmethodology leverages the definition of POD spatial modes as eigenvectors of\nthe spatial correlation matrix, where local measurements, even when not\nobtained simultaneously, provide each a portion of the latter, which is then\nanalyzed to synthesize the full-domain spatial modes. The measurement domain\ncoverage is found to require regions overlapping by 50-75% to yield a smooth\ndistribution of the modes. The procedure identifies structures twice as large\nas each measurement patch. The technique, referred to as Patch POD, is applied\nto planar PIV data of a submerged jet flow where the effect of patching is\nsimulated by splitting the original PIV data. Patch POD is then extended to 3D\nrobotic measurement around a wall-mounted cube. The results show that the\npatching technique enables global modal analysis over a domain covered with a\nmultitude of non-simultaneous measurements.",

    "abstract":"Robotic kitting is a critical task in industrial automation that requires the\nprecise arrangement of objects into kits to support downstream production\nprocesses. However, when handling complex kitting tasks that involve\nfine-grained orientation alignment, existing approaches often suffer from\nlimited accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we\npropose Histogram Transporter, a novel kitting framework that learns\nhigh-precision pick-and-place actions from scratch using only a few\ndemonstrations. First, our method extracts rotation-equivariant orientation\nhistograms (EOHs) from visual observations using an efficient Fourier-based\ndiscretization strategy. These EOHs serve a dual purpose: improving picking\nefficiency by directly modeling action success probabilities over\nhigh-resolution orientations and enhancing placing accuracy by serving as\nlocal, discriminative feature descriptors for object-to-placement matching.\nSecond, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that\ncompresses the full spectrum of EOHs into a compact orientation representation,\nenabling efficient feature matching while preserving accuracy. Finally, we\nexamine the proposed framework on the simulated Hand-Tool Kitting Dataset\n(HTKD), where it outperforms competitive baselines in both success rates and\ncomputational efficiency. Further experiments on five Raven-10 tasks exhibits\nthe remarkable adaptability of our approach, with real-robot trials confirming\nits applicability for real-world deployment.",

In Michiyama et al. (2021), [C I]\n$^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ emission in NGC 7679 was reported as undetected based on ACA\nobservations conducted in 2019 (ALMA Cycle 6). These observations had ~1 minute\non-source time and used a single pointing with a field of view (FoV) of ~20\narcsec. In 2023 (Cycle 9), we carried out mosaic observations using seven\npointings with an FoV of ~27 arcsec and 4-5 minutes on-source per pointing. The\nadditional data have significantly improved the line sensitivity, uv-sampling,\nand noise uniformity across the galaxy disk. Our Cycle 9 observations confirm\nthe presence of extended [C I] $^3P_1$--$^3P_0$ emission in NGC 7679, which was\ncompletely missed in the Cycle 6 observations due to insufficient sensitivity\nand uv-sampling.

On the other hand,\nhackathons have attracted increasing attention due to their experiential,\ncollaborative, and intensive nature, which certain tasks could be similar to\nreal-world software development. This paper aims to discuss the idea of\nhackathons as an educational strategy for shaping SE students' soft skills in\npractice. Initially, we overview the existing literature on soft skills and\nhackathons in SE education. Then, we report preliminary empirical evidence from\na seven-day hybrid hackathon involving 40 students. We assess how the hackathon\nexperience promoted innovative and creative thinking, collaboration and\nteamwork, and knowledge application among participants through a structured\nquestionnaire designed to evaluate students' self-awareness. Lastly, our\nfindings and new directions are analyzed through the lens of Self-Determination\nTheory, which offers a psychological lens to understand human behavior. This\npaper contributes to academia by advocating the potential of hackathons in SE\neducation and proposing concrete plans for future research within SDT. For\nindustry, our discussion has implications around developing soft skills in\nfuture SE professionals, thereby enhancing their employability and readiness in\nthe software market.",

    "abstract":"The recent availability of step-edge, frit-disc crucible sets (generally sold\nas Canfield Crucible Sets or CCS) has led to multiple innovations associated\nwith our group's use of solution growth. Use of CCS allows for the clean\nseparation of liquid from solid phases during the growth process. This clean\nseparation enables the reuse of the decanted liquid, either allowing for\nsimple, economic, savings associated with recycling expensive precursor\nelements or allowing for the fractionation of a growth into multiple, small\nsteps, revealing the progression of multiple solidifications. Clean separation\nof liquid from solid phases also allows for the determination of the liquidus\nline (or surface) and the creation, or correction, of composition-temperature\nphase diagrams. The reuse of clean decanted liquid has also allowed us to\nprepare liquids ideally suited for the growth of large single crystals of\nspecific phases by tuning the composition of the melt to the optimal\ncomposition for growth of the desired phase, often with reduced nucleation\nsites. Finally, we discuss how solution growth and CCS use can be harnessed to\nprovide a plethora of composition-temperature data points defining liquidus\nlines or surfaces with differing degrees of precision to either test or anchor\nartificial intelligence and\/or machine learning based attempts to augment and\nextend the limited experimentally determined data base.",

    "title":"Similar-mass versus diverse-mass planetary systems in wind-driven\n  accretion discs",
    "abstract":"Many close-in multiple-planet systems show a peas-in-a-pod trend, where\nneighbouring planets have similar sizes, masses, and orbital spacing. Others,\nincluding the Solar System, have a more diverse size and mass distribution.\nClassical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the\nlatter, and the origin of this difference remains unclear. Recent studies\nsuggest disc evolution is largely driven by magnetic winds rather than\nviscosity alone. In such wind-driven accretion discs, the mass accretion rate\nvaries radially instead of being constant, as in classical viscous discs. We\ninvestigate how the wind's efficiency in removing disc mass affects planet\nformation and migration. We performed single-core planet formation simulations\nvia pebble accretion in wind-driven accretion discs. We varied wind efficiency\nvia the magnetic lever arm parameter $ \\lambda $ and studied outcomes by\nconsidering a range of initial disc masses and accretion timescales. Our\nsimulations show that higher $ \\lambda $ discs, with less wind mass loss, lead\nto faster formation and migration, generating similar-mass planetary systems.\nLower $ \\lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more\ndiverse-mass planetary systems. A mass jump occurs for all $ \\lambda $ cases\nwhen planet formation and disc accretion timescales are comparable, but is\nlarger for lower $ \\lambda $ discs. Super-Earth systems with cold Jupiters form\nmore frequently in metal-rich discs, consistent with observations. Our\nsimulations suggest similar-mass and diverse-mass systems are approximately\nseparated at $ \\lambda \\sim 2\\text{--}3 $.",

    "abstract":"Designing high-performance routing protocols for flying ad hoc networks\n(FANETs) is challenging due to the diversity of applications and the dynamics\nof network topology. The existing general-purpose routing protocols for ad hoc\nnetworks often oversimplify mobility patterns and disregard the unequal\nimportance of nodes, resulting in suboptimal routing decisions that are\nunsuitable for task-oriented FANETs. To break the bottleneck, in this paper we\npropose a betweenness centrality based dynamic source routing (BC-DSR) protocol\nfor a flying ad hoc network (FANET) in marching formation. Firstly, we\nintroduce a Gauss-Markov group (GMG) mobility model based on the\nleader-follower pattern, which accurately captures the temporal and spatial\ncorrelations of node movements in the realistic marching formation. Besides, we\nexploit the concept of BC defined in graph theory to measure the structural\nunequal importance of relay nodes, i.e., to determine link weights, in the\nparticular marching formation topology. The path of least cost is calculated\nrelying on a weighted directed graph constructed. The ns-3 based simulation\nresults demonstrate that our BCDSR protocol achieves higher packet-delivery\nratio and lower average end-to-end latency and routing overhead ratio than\nrepresentative benchmark protocols used in FANETs, while maintaining a\nreasonably small network jitter.",

Controlling spin currents with different polarization is urgently\ndemanded but remains hitherto elusive. Here, we demonstrate the control of spin\ncurrents at room temperature by magnon interference in a canted\nantiferromagnet, hematite recently also classified as an altermagnet.\nMagneto-optical characterization by Brillouin light scattering revealed that\nthe spatial periodicity of the beating patterns was tunable via the microwave\nfrequency. The inverse spin-Hall voltage changed sign as the frequency was\nscanned, i.e., a frequency-controlled switching of polarization in pure spin\ncurrents was obtained.

At the\nsame time, 6G is also expected to support millions of low-powered\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Previous studies have demonstrated that the\npower requirements of these IoT devices can be met through wireless power\ntransfer facilitated by intelligent metasurfaces. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntry to formulate and answer a fundamental question: How much transmit power is\nrequired for an integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT)\nsystem? More specifically, we consider the problem of optimal active, passive,\nand receive beamforming design for a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-enabled ISCPT system with\nmultiple sensing targets, multiple information receivers, and multiple energy\nreceivers, to minimize the required transmit power from the base station, while\nguaranteeing predefined sensing, communication, and energy harvesting\nrequirements. To tackle the challenging non-convex optimization problem, we use\nan alternating optimization (AO)-based approach, where the receive beamforming\nis obtained in closed form while the active and passive beamforming are\nobtained using a second-order cone program (SOCP) approach. Our numerical\nresults show the benefit of using STAR-RIS to reduce the transmit power\nrequirement for the ISCPT system compared to its corresponding conventional RIS\n(cRIS)-enabled and non-RIS ISCPT systems.",

    "abstract":"How do regular black holes evade the Penrose singularity theorem? Various\nmodels of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence\ncondition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must\ngenerically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the Penrose\ntheorem. In fact, the Penrose singularity theorem depends on subtle global\nassumptions and does not provide information about where and when the\nsingularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached\nat finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the\nregion inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically,\nthe Bardeen, Dymnikova, Hayward models of stationary regular black holes\nfeature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence\nviolating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and\nfurthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of\ngravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing\nkinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black\nholes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon -- when present -- need\nnot act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the\nNCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions.\nOur detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such\nkinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect\nthe NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce\nspacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC\nis always violated. These findings offer new insights into how regular black\nholes and related objects evade the constraints imposed by the Penrose\nsingularity theorem.",

    "abstract":"With the advent of ever more intense and focused X-ray sources, including in\nlaboratories, at synchrotrons, and at X-ray free electron lasers,\nradiation-induced sample change and damage are becoming increasingly\nchallenging. Therefore, the exploration of possible mitigation strategies is\ncrucial to continue to allow the collection of robust and repeatable data. One\nmitigation approach is the introduction of short, X-ray-free ``dark'' periods.\nHowever, it is unclear whether this strategy minimises damage or, in actuality,\npromotes it through a phenomenon called ``dark progression'', i.e. the increase\nor progression of radiation damage that occurs after the X-ray beam is turned\noff. This work discusses the influence of introducing dark periods and their\nduration on the radiation-induced changes in two model small-molecule\ncatalysts, [Ir(COD)Cl]$_2$ and [Rh(COD)Cl]$_2$, exposed to X-ray radiation in\npowder diffraction (PXRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments.\nThis provides, for the first time, insights into how damage progresses under\nvarying radiation regimes and allows the distinction between the processes that\naffect the unit cell itself, the individual molecular units, and the respective\natomic chemical environments. Furthermore, it provides the basis for informed\ndecision-making in the design of future experiments where the need to minimise\nradiation-induced damage is crucial.",

    "title":"MLLM-For3D: Adapting Multimodal Large Language Model for 3D Reasoning\n  Segmentation",
    "abstract":"Reasoning segmentation aims to segment target objects in complex scenes based\non human intent and spatial reasoning. While recent multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation,\nadapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper,\nwe introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers\nknowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize\nMLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text\nembeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text\nembeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial\nconsistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects\nthat do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D\nmodel with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address\nthis, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation\nmasks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of\nthe scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal\nsemantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object\nacross different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor\nscene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data,\nMLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively\ninterpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial\nrelationships.",

    "abstract":"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to train language models to\nimitate annotated responses for given instructions. In this paper, we challenge\nthis paradigm and propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), a strategy where models\nlearn to critique noisy responses rather than simply imitate correct ones.\nInspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, CFT\nencourages deeper analysis and nuanced understanding-traits often overlooked by\nstandard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, we construct a 50K-sample\ndataset from WebInstruct, using GPT-4o as the teacher to generate critiques in\nthe form of ([query; noisy response], critique). CFT on this dataset yields a\nconsistent 4-10% improvement over SFT on six math benchmarks with different\nbase models like Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math and DeepSeek-Math. We further expand to\nMetaMath and NuminaMath datasets and observe similar gains over SFT. Notably,\nour model Qwen2.5-Math-CFT only requires 1 hour training on 8xH100 over the 50K\nexamples. It can match or outperform strong competitors like\nQwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, which use over 2M samples. Moreover,\nit can match the performance of SimpleRL, which is a deepseek-r1 replication\ntrained with 140x more compute. Ablation studies show that CFT is robust to the\nsource of noisy response and teacher critique model. Through these findings, we\nargue that CFT offers a more effective alternative to advance the reasoning of\nlanguage models.",

    "title":"Identifying compact symmetric objects with high-precision VLBI and Gaia\n  astrometry",
    "abstract":"Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) represent a key early stage in radio galaxy\nevolution, but their reliable identification remains challenging. We develop a\nmethod to identify CSOs by combining Gaia optical astrometry with VLBI radio\nimaging. We analyze 40 CSO candidates by overlaying Gaia DR3 positions on VLBI\nmaps to locate their central engines. CSOs are confirmed when Gaia positions\nlie between symmetric radio lobes, while core-jet sources show optical\npositions coinciding with one end of the radio structure. We verify\nclassifications using spectral indices, variability, and jet kinematics from\nmulti-epoch VLBI observations. Our method identified 22 genuine CSOs and 10\ncore-jet sources, with 8 objects remaining ambiguous. Confirmed CSOs show\nkinematic ages from 20 to over 1000 years and hotspot speeds typically below\n0.5c. Five nearby CSOs show optical-radio offsets despite strong CSO\nmorphology, indicating host galaxy influence. The Gaia-VLBI method provides a\nreliable CSO identification tool. Our sample reveals diverse radio powers,\nsuggesting multiple evolutionary paths. CSO evolution appears influenced by\nboth intrinsic jet power and environmental factors, with high-power CSOs\npotentially evolving into large-scale radio galaxies while low-power CSOs often\nshow confinement by their host environments.",

This tuning induces\nthe merging of Dirac points at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone,\ngoverned by the field parameters.

    "abstract":"We report on a combined structural and magnetotransport study of Hall bar\ndevices of various lateral dimensions patterned side-by-side on epitaxial\nPdCoO$_2$ thin films. We study the effects of both the thickness of the\nPdCoO$_2$ film and the width of the channel on the electronic transport and the\nmagnetoresistance properties of the Hall bar devices. All the films with\nthicknesses down to 4.88 nm are epitaxially oriented, phase pure, and exhibit a\nmetallic behavior. At room temperature, the Hall bar device with the channel\nwidth $\\text{W}=2.5\\, \\mu\\text{m}$ exhibits a record resistivity value of\n$0.85\\,\\mu\\Omega$cm, while the value of $2.70\\,\\mu\\Omega$cm is obtained in a\nwider device with channel width $\\text{W}=10\\, \\mu\\text{m}$. For the 4.88 nm\nthick sample, we find that while the density of the conduction electrons is\ncomparable in both channels, the electrons move about twice as fast in the\nnarrower channel. At low temperatures, for Hall bar devices of channel width\n$2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ fabricated on epitaxial films of thicknesses 4.88 and 5.21\nnm, the electron mobilities of $\\approx$ 65 and 40 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively, are extracted. For thin-film Hall bar devices of width\n$10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ fabricated on the same 4.88 and 5.21 nm thick samples, the\nmobility values of $\\approx$ 32 and 18 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ are obtained. The\nmagnetoresistance characteristics of these PdCoO$_2$ films are observed to be\ntemperature dependent and exhibit a dependency with the orientation of the\napplied magnetic field. When the applied field is oriented 90{\\deg} away from\nthe crystal $c$-axis, a persistent negative MR at all temperatures is observed;\nwhereas when the field is parallel to the $c$-axis, the negative\nmagnetoresistance is suppressed at temperatures above 150K.",

    "abstract":"We propose modifying topological quantum error correcting codes by\nincorporating space-time defects, termed ``time vortices,'' to reduce the\nnumber of physical qubits required to achieve a desired logical error rate. A\ntime vortex is inserted by adding a spatially varying delay to the periodic\nmeasurement sequence defining the code such that the delay accumulated on a\nhomologically non-trivial cycle is an integer multiple of the period. We\nanalyze this construction within the framework of the Floquet color code and\noptimize the embedding of the code on a torus along with the choice of the\nnumber of time vortices inserted in each direction. Asymptotically, the\nvortexed code requires less than half the number of qubits as the vortex-free\ncode to reach a given code distance. We benchmark the performance of the\nvortexed Floquet color code by Monte Carlo simulations with a circuit-level\nnoise model and demonstrate that the smallest vortexed code (with $30$ qubits)\noutperforms the vortex-free code with $42$ qubits.",

    "title":"KVQ: Boosting Video Quality Assessment via Saliency-guided Local\n  Perception",
    "abstract":"Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which intends to predict the perceptual\nquality of videos, has attracted increasing attention. Due to factors like\nmotion blur or specific distortions, the quality of different regions in a\nvideo varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is\nbeneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting\nfine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of\nannotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from\nrelevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception.\nInspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the\nlocal texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a\nKaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to\neffectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the\nassessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and\nallocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a\nLocal Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture\nperception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across\nmultiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods.\nFurthermore, to assess local perception, we establish a new Local Perception\nVisual Quality (LPVQ) dataset with region-wise annotations. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the capability of KVQ in perceiving local distortions. KVQ\nmodels and the LPVQ dataset will be available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/qyp2000\/KVQ.",

    "title":"Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Architecture Designs, Opportunities,\n  and Outlook",
    "abstract":"This article proposes a novel design for the Pinching Antenna SyStems (PASS)\nand advocates simple yet efficient wireless communications over the ``last\nmeter''. First, the potential benefits of PASS are discussed in the paper by\nreviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced,\nincluding their physical principles, signal models, and communication designs.\nIn contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept,\ntermed \\emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting\nthe positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Based on this concept, a couple of\npractical transmission architectures are proposed for realizing the full\npotentia of PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More\nparticularly, 1) the non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple\nbaseband signal processing and relies on the pinching beamforming only; while\n2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal processing\ncapabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which can be further\ndivided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based\nfully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put\nforward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further\nadvance, by demonstrating a few numerical case studies, the significant\nperformance gain of PASS is revealed compared to conventional multi-antenna\nsystems. Finally, several research opportunities and open problems of PASS are\nhighlighted.",

    "title":"COLOR: A compositional linear operation-based representation of protein\n  sequences for identification of monomer contributions to properties",
    "abstract":"The properties of biological materials like proteins and nucleic acids are\nlargely determined by their primary sequence. While certain segments in the\nsequence strongly influence specific functions, identifying these segments, or\nso-called motifs, is challenging due to the complexity of sequential data.\nWhile deep learning (DL) models can accurately capture sequence-property\nrelationships, the degree of nonlinearity in these models limits the assessment\nof monomer contributions to a property - a critical step in identifying key\nmotifs. Recent advances in explainable AI (XAI) offer attention and\ngradient-based methods for estimating monomeric contributions. However, these\nmethods are primarily applied to classification tasks, such as binding site\nidentification, where they achieve limited accuracy (40-45%) and rely on\nqualitative evaluations. To address these limitations, we introduce a DL model\nwith interpretable steps, enabling direct tracing of monomeric contributions.\nWe also propose a metric ($\\mathcal{I}$), inspired by the masking technique in\nthe field of image analysis and natural language processing, for quantitative\nanalysis on datasets mainly containing distinct properties of anti-cancer\npeptides (ACP), antimicrobial peptides (AMP), and collagen. Our model exhibits\n22% higher explainability, pinpoints critical motifs (RRR, RRI, and RSS) that\nsignificantly destabilize ACPs, and identifies motifs in AMPs that are 50% more\neffective in converting non-AMPs to AMPs. These findings highlight the\npotential of our model in guiding mutation strategies for designing\nprotein-based biomaterials.",

    "abstract":"Machine learning techniques have conquered many different tasks in speech and\nnatural language processing, such as speech recognition, information\nextraction, text and speech generation, and human machine interaction using\nnatural language or speech (chatbots). Modern techniques typically rely on\nlarge models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages\n(Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio\ncharacteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech\nand language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with\nsuch technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by\nhow far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been\ntrained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the\nlanguage used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to\nsome gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and\nusers who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies.\nOn top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs,\nunder-represented languages and dialects\/sociolects may decrease in terms of\npriorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is\nnot available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language\ntechnology usage.

    "abstract":"The validity range of the widely used traditional effective range expansion\ncan be severely limited by the presence of a left-hand cut near the\ntwo-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut emerges in two-particle scattering\nprocesses involving either a light particle exchange in the $t$-channel or a\nparticle exchange with a mass slightly heavier than the mass difference of the\ntwo particles in the $u$-channel, which occurs in a wide range of physical\nsystems. We propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering\namplitude that incorporates these left-hand cuts arising from particle exchange\ndiagrams. This parameterization extends the convergence radius of the effective\nrange expansion beyond the branch point of the left-hand cut and is applicable\nto a broad range of systems. The parameterization enables the extraction of\ncoupling strengths between the exchange particle and the scattering particles,\nand reveals amplitude zeros resulting from the interplay between short- and\nlong-range interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new\nparameterization through its application to $DD^*$ scattering with meson masses\nobtained in a lattice QCD calculation.",

    "abstract":"This study explores the mechanisms of spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching in\nferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\n(PMA), emphasizing the impact of symmetry-breaking. Using micromagnetic\nsimulations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, we examine\nseveral symmetry-breaking factors, including bias field misalignment,\ninterlayer exchange coupling, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted\nmagnetic anisotropy. The results reveal that bias field misalignment relative\nto the film plane significantly distorts the SOT switching hysteresis.\nAdditionally, intrinsic symmetry-breaking effects, such as internal coupling\nfields, out-of-plane spin polarization, and tilted anisotropy, facilitate\nfield-free SOT (FF-SOT) switching without external bias fields. Each type of\nFF-SOT switching exhibits distinct characteristics, including hysteresis\nshifts, switching ratios, and saturated magnetization. This work emphasizes the\nrole of symmetry-breaking in FF-SOT switching and offers fundamental\ninformation for interpreting FF-SOT switching observed from FMS films in\nexperiments, contributing to the optimization of SOT efficiency and the\nadvancement of spintronics technologies.",

    "abstract":"Context. Recent developments in exoplanetary research highlight the\nimportance of Love numbers in understanding their internal dynamics, formation,\nmigration history and their potential habitability. Love numbers represent\ncrucial parameters that gauge how exoplanets respond to external forces such as\ntidal interactions and rotational effects. By measuring these responses, we can\ngain insights into the internal structure, composition, and density\ndistribution of exoplanets. The rate of apsidal precession of a planetary orbit\nis directly linked to the second-order fluid Love number, thus we can gain\nvaluable insights into the mass distribution of the planet. Aims. In this\ncontext, we aim to re-determine the orbital parameters of WASP-43b-in\nparticular, orbital period, eccentricity, and argument of the periastron-and\nits orbital evolution. We study the outcomes of the tidal interaction with the\nhost star:whether tidal decay and periastron precession are occurring in the\nsystem. Method. We observed the system with HARPS, whose data we present for\nthe first time, and we also analyse the newly acquired JWST full-phase light\ncurve. We fit jointly archival and new radial velocity and transit and\noccultation mid-times, including tidal decay, periastron precession and\nlong-term acceleration in the system. Results. We detected a tidal decay rate\nof \\dotP_a=(-1.99pm0.50) and a periastron precession rate of\n\\dotomega=(0.1851+0.0070-0.0077)=(0.1727+0.0083-0.0089)deg\/d=(621.72+29.88-32.04)arcsec\/d.\nThis is the first time that both periastron precession and tidal decay are\nsimultaneously detected in an exoplanetary system. The observed tidal\ninteractions can neither be explained by the tidal contribution to apsidal\nmotion of a non-aligned stellar or planetary rotation axis nor by assuming\nnon-synchronous rotation for the planet, and a value for the planetary Love\nnumber cannot be derived.

    "abstract":"Continual learning aims to acquire new knowledge while retaining past\ninformation. Class-incremental learning (CIL) presents a challenging scenario\nwhere classes are introduced sequentially. For video data, the task becomes\nmore complex than image data because it requires learning and preserving both\nspatial appearance and temporal action involvement. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a novel exemplar-free framework that equips separate spatiotemporal\nadapters to learn new class patterns, accommodating the incremental information\nrepresentation requirements unique to each class. While separate adapters are\nproven to mitigate forgetting and fit unique requirements, naively applying\nthem hinders the intrinsic connection between spatial and temporal information\nincrements, affecting the efficiency of representing newly learned class\ninformation. Motivated by this, we introduce two key innovations from a causal\nperspective. First, a causal distillation module is devised to maintain the\nrelation between spatial-temporal knowledge for a more efficient\nrepresentation. Second, a causal compensation mechanism is proposed to reduce\nthe conflicts during increment and memorization between different types of\ninformation. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our framework can achieve new state-of-the-art results, surpassing current\nexample-based methods by 4.2% in accuracy on average.",

    "abstract":"As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security\nissues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an\neffective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been\nwidely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be\nfully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety\nunlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs.\nWe comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget\nquality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle\nto maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often\nsuffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to\nalleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To\nquantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new\nmetric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate\nthat combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent\nover-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B\nand LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility.

However, the\nadvantage of area scaling through CFETs is hindered by the imbalance in N\/P\ntransistor counts (typically 4N\/2P) within SRAM cells. In this work, we propose\na novel 6T-SRAM design using three sets of CFETs, achieved by vertically\nstacking two n-FET pass-gate (PG) transistors via the CFET architecture.\nThrough TCAD simulations, we optimize channel doping concentration and the\nnumber of top\/bottom nanosheets (NS), demonstrating that junctionless\naccumulation mode (JAM) devices outperform inversion mode (IM) devices for PG\nand pull-down (PD) transistors. The proposed design achieves a 37% area\nreduction in SRAM standard cell layout compared to conventional CFET-based\nSRAM. With optimized parameters (n-type doping of \\(1\\times10^{15}\\)\ncm\\(^{-3}\\) and '1B4T' NS configuration), the 3-CFET SRAM exhibits superior\nwrite margin (349.60 mV) and write delay (54.4 ps).

The 944 MHz EMU image shows a roughly semicircular HII region\nwith an integrated flux density of 30.2$\\pm$0.3 mJy.

Sparse MIMO relaxes the traditional\nhalf-wavelength antenna spacing constraint to enlarge the antenna aperture,\nthus enhancing localization degrees of freedom and providing finer spatial\nresolution. However, it also leads to undesired grating lobes, which may cause\nsevere inter-user interference for communication and angular ambiguity for\nlocalization. While the latter issue can be effectively addressed by the\nvirtual array technology, by forming sum or difference co-arrays via signal\n(conjugate) correlation among array elements, it is unclear whether the similar\nvirtual array technology also benefits wireless communications for ILAC\nsystems. In this paper, we first reveal that the answer to the above question\nis negative, by showing that forming virtual arrays for wireless communication\nwill cause destruction of phase information, degradation of signal-to-noise\nratio and aggravation of multi-user interference. Therefore, we propose the\nhybrid processing for sparse MIMO based ILAC, i.e., physical array based\ncommunication while virtual array based localization. To this end, we\ncharacterize the beam pattern of sparse arrays by three metrics, demonstrating\nthat despite of the introduction of grating lobes, sparse arrays can also bring\nbenefits to communications thanks to its narrower main lobe beam width than the\nconventional compact arrays. Extensive simulation results are presented to\ndemonstrate the performance gains of sparse MIMO based ILAC over that based on\nthe conventional compact MIMO.",

Using\nthe modular structure of MGMT, we compare seven architectures (among them,\nRNNs, CNNs, and Transformers) for embedding tabular datasets on the auxiliary\ntask of contrastive learning for tabular data sets on an equation discovery\ntask. For almost all combinations of modules, supervised learning outperforms\nreinforcement learning.

However, to do the reverse and determine\ninformation about the nature of the disorder purely from transport measurements\nis a far more difficult task. In this work, we apply a recently developed\ninversion technique to identify important structural information about\nedge-disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbons. The inversion tool decodes the\nelectronic transmission spectrum to obtain the overall level of edge vacancies\nin this type of device. We also consider the role of spin-polarised states at\nthe ribbon edges and demonstrate that, in addition to edge roughness, the\ninversion procedure can also be used to detect the presence of magnetism in\nsuch nanoribbons. We finally show that if the transmission for both spin\norientations is available, for example by using ferromagnetic contacts in a\ntransport measurement, then additional structural information about the\nrelative concentration of defects on each edge can be derived.",

    "abstract":"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to train a model on seen classes and recognize\nunseen classes by knowledge transfer through shared auxiliary information.\nRecent studies reveal that documents from encyclopedias provide helpful\nauxiliary information. However, existing methods align noisy documents,\nentangled in visual and non-visual descriptions, with image regions, yet solely\ndepend on implicit learning. These models fail to filter non-visual noise\nreliably and incorrectly align non-visual words to image regions, which is\nharmful to knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attribute\ndocument supervision framework to remove noises at both document collection and\nmodel learning stages. With the help of large language models, we introduce a\nnovel prompt algorithm that automatically removes non-visual descriptions and\nenriches less-described documents in multiple attribute views. Our proposed\nmodel, MADS, extracts multi-view transferable knowledge with information\ndecoupling and semantic interactions for semantic alignment at local and global\nlevels. Besides, we introduce a model-agnostic focus loss to explicitly enhance\nattention to visually discriminative information during training, also\nimproving existing methods without additional parameters. With comparable\ncomputation costs, MADS consistently outperforms the SOTA by 7.2% and 8.2% on\naverage in three benchmarks for document-based ZSL and GZSL settings,\nrespectively.

We hypothesize that the primary issue lies in the\nuniformity of LLM outputs, which leads to inefficient sampling as models\nrepeatedly generate similar but inaccurate responses. Motivated by an\nintriguing relationship between solution accuracy (Pass@10) and response\ndiversity, we propose DivSampling -- a novel and versatile sampling technique\ndesigned to enhance the diversity of candidate solutions by introducing prompt\nperturbations.DivSampling incorporates two categories of perturbations:\ntask-agnostic approaches, which are general and not tailored to any specific\ntask, and task-specific approaches, which are customized based on task content.\nOur theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the error\nrates of responses generated from diverse prompts are significantly lower\ncompared to those produced by stationary prompts. Comprehensive evaluations\nacross various tasks -- including reasoning, mathematics, and code generation\n-- highlight the effectiveness of DivSampling in improving solution accuracy.\nThis scalable and efficient approach offers a new perspective on optimizing\ntest-time inference, addressing limitations in current sampling strategies.",

    "abstract":"Deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) is a powerful probe for investigating the\nQCD structure of hadronic matter and testing the standard model (SM). DIS can\nbe described through QCD factorization theorems which separate contributions to\nthe scattering interaction arising from disparate scales - e.g., with\nnonperturbative matrix elements associated with long distances and a\nperturbative hard scattering kernel applying to short-distance parton-level\ninteractions. The fundamental underpinnings of factorization may be recast in\nthe quantum-theoretic terms of entanglement, (de)coherence, and system\nlocalization in a fashion which sheds complementary light on the dynamics at\nwork in DIS from QCD bound states. In this Letter, we propose and\nquantitatively test such a quantum-information theoretic approach for\ndissecting factorization in DIS and its domain of validity; we employ metrics\nassociated with quantum entanglement such as a differential quantum entropy and\nassociated KL divergences in numerical tests. We deploy these methods on an\narchetypal quark-spectator model of the proton, for which we monitor quantum\ndecoherence in DIS as underlying model parameters are varied. On this basis, we\ndemonstrate quantitatively how factorization-breaking effects may be imprinted\non quantum entropies in a kinematic regime where leading-twist factorization\nincreasingly receives large corrections from finite-$Q^2$ effects; our findings\nsuggest potential applications of quantum simulation to QCD systems and their\ninteractions.",

    "abstract":"Decarbonization, decentralization and digitalization are the three key\nelements driving the twin energy transition. The energy system is evolving to a\nmore data driven ecosystem, leading to the need of communication and storage of\nlarge amount of data of different resolution from the prosumers and other\nstakeholders in the energy ecosystem. While the energy system is certainly\nadvancing, this paradigm shift is bringing in new privacy and security issues\nrelated to collection, processing and storage of data - not only from the\ntechnical dimension, but also from the regulatory perspective. Understanding\ndata privacy and security in the evolving energy system, regarding regulatory\ncompliance, is an immature field of research. Contextualized knowledge of how\nrelated issues are regulated is still in its infancy, and the practical and\ntechnical basis for the regulatory framework for data privacy and security is\nnot clear. To fill this gap, this paper conducts a comprehensive review of the\ndata-related issues for the energy system by integrating both technical and\nregulatory dimensions. We start by reviewing open-access data, data\ncommunication and data-processing techniques for the energy system, and use it\nas the basis to connect the analysis of data-related issues from the integrated\nperspective. We classify the issues into three categories: (i) data-sharing\namong energy end users and stakeholders (ii) privacy of end users, and (iii)\ncyber security, and then explore these issues from a regulatory perspective. We\nanalyze the evolution of related regulations, and introduce the relevant\nregulatory initiatives for the categorized issues in terms of regulatory\ndefinitions, concepts, principles, rights and obligations in the context of\nenergy systems. Finally, we provide reflections on the gaps that still exist,\nand guidelines for regulatory frameworks for a truly participatory energy\nsystem.",

    "abstract":"Magnetic frustration is a key ingredient to prevent conventional ordering\nand, in combination with enhanced fluctuations in low dimensional quantum\nmagnets, to stabilize the long sought spin liquid ground states. Most\nexperimental spin liquid candidates inevitably deviate from perfectly\nfrustrated models due to chemical and structural disorder, blurring the nature\nand origin of their ground states. Y-Kapellasite Y$_3$Cu$_9$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_{8}$\nrealizes a chemically clean system with an underlying kagome sub-lattice. The\ncrystals undergo the theoretically predicted magnetic in-plane (1\/3 1\/3) order\nfrom a subtle release of frustration due to a distortion of the kagome system\nrealised by displaced Y atoms. By studying the effect of pressure on the\nstructure and optical phonons, we show that this distortion is partially lifted\nby compression towards a more isotropic model of interactions, in a gradual\nmanner, without structural transition. Using $\\mu$SR, we further show that the\nmagnetic ground state is surprisingly sensitive to the applied pressure for a\nmineral, and that under a moderate 2 GPa pressure, the frustration increase is\nsufficient to induce a fluctuating ground state. Suppressing long-range\nmagnetic order via frustration tuning with pressure, in an ultraclean material,\nestablishes a major step towards realizing a well-controlled spin liquid ground\nstate.",

    "abstract":"Facial Aesthetics Enhancement (FAE) aims to improve facial attractiveness by\nadjusting the structure and appearance of a facial image while preserving its\nidentity as much as possible. Most existing methods adopted deep feature-based\nor score-based guidance for generation models to conduct FAE. Although these\nmethods achieved promising results, they potentially produced excessively\nbeautified results with lower identity consistency or insufficiently improved\nfacial attractiveness. To enhance facial aesthetics with less loss of identity,\nwe propose the Nearest Neighbor Structure Guidance based on Diffusion\n(NNSG-Diffusion), a diffusion-based FAE method that beautifies a 2D facial\nimage with 3D structure guidance. Specifically, we propose to extract FAE\nguidance from a nearest neighbor reference face. To allow for less change of\nfacial structures in the FAE process, a 3D face model is recovered by referring\nto both the matched 2D reference face and the 2D input face, so that the depth\nand contour guidance can be extracted from the 3D face model. Then the depth\nand contour clues can provide effective guidance to Stable Diffusion with\nControlNet for FAE. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is\nsuperior to previous relevant methods in enhancing facial aesthetics while\npreserving facial identity.",

Under an additional generalized\nLipschitz property of the first operator, sublinear convergence rate is derived\nfor the sequence generated by our adaptive algorithm. Moreover, if the sum is\nuniformly pseudo-monotone, linear\/sublinear rates are derived depending on the\nparameter of uniform pseudo-monotonicity.

    "abstract":"Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework\nfor modeling continuous signals. The spectral bias of ReLU-based networks is a\nwell-established limitation, restricting their ability to capture fine-grained\ndetails in target signals. While previous works have attempted to mitigate this\nissue through frequency-based encodings or architectural modifications, these\napproaches often introduce additional complexity and do not fully address the\nunderlying challenge of learning high-frequency components efficiently. We\nintroduce Sinusoidal Trainable Activation Functions (STAF), designed to\ndirectly tackle this limitation by enabling networks to adaptively learn and\nrepresent complex signals with higher precision and efficiency. STAF inherently\nmodulates its frequency components, allowing for self-adaptive spectral\nlearning. This capability significantly improves convergence speed and\nexpressivity, making STAF highly effective for both signal representations and\ninverse problems. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that STAF\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in accuracy and reconstruction\nfidelity with superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). These results\nestablish STAF as a robust solution for overcoming spectral bias and the\ncapacity-convergence gap, making it valuable for computer graphics and related\nfields.

    "abstract":"Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive\ndeployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance\nsystems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public\nsafety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such\nas haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly\ndegrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability\nof these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of\ndeveloping adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified\nscene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image\ndegradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a\nscene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM),\nan edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by\nadvanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a\nprogressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To\nenhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce\nNILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios\nwith precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed\nto extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining\nimage sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses\nexisting methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving\nthe accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios.

    "abstract":"Cerebral perfusion plays a crucial role in maintaining brain function and is\ntightly coupled with neuronal activity. While previous studies have examined\ncerebral perfusion trajectories across development and aging, precise\ncharacterization of its lifespan dynamics has been limited by small sample\nsizes and methodological inconsistencies. In this study, we construct the first\ncomprehensive normative model of cerebral perfusion across the human lifespan\n(birth to 85 years) using a large multi-site dataset of over 12,000\nhigh-quality arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans. Leveraging generalized\nadditive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we mapped nonlinear\ngrowth trajectories of cerebral perfusion at global, network, and regional\nlevels. We observed a rapid postnatal increase in cerebral perfusion, peaking\nat approximately 7.1 years, followed by a gradual decline into adulthood. Sex\ndifferences were evident, with distinct regional maturation patterns rather\nthan uniform differences across all brain regions. Beyond normative modeling,\nwe quantified individual deviations from expected CBF patterns in\nneurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, identifying disease-specific\nperfusion abnormalities across four brain disorders. Using longitudinal data,\nwe established typical and atypical cerebral perfusion trajectories,\nhighlighting the prognostic value of perfusion-based biomarkers for detecting\ndisease progression. Our findings provide a robust normative framework for\ncerebral perfusion, facilitating precise characterization of brain health\nacross the lifespan and enhancing the early identification of neurovascular\ndysfunction in clinical populations.",

    "abstract":"As quantum technologies transition from the research laboratory into\ncommercial development, the opportunities for students to begin their careers\nin this new quantum industry are increasing. With these new career pathways,\nmore and more people are considering the best ways to educate students about\nquantum concepts and relevant skills. In particular, the quantum industry is\nlooking for new employees with experimental skills, but the instructional labs,\ncapstone projects, research experiences, and internships that provide\nexperiences where students can learn these skills are often resource-intensive\nand not available at all institutions. The quantum company, Infleqtion,\nrecently made its online quantum matter machine Oqtant publicly available, so\npeople around the world could send commands to create and manipulate\nBose-Einstein condensates and receive back real experimental data. Making a\ncomplex quantum experiment accessible to anyone has the potential to extend the\nopportunity to work with quantum experiments to students at less-resourced\ninstitutions. As a first step in understanding the potential benefits of using\nsuch a platform in educational settings, we collected data from instructors and\nstudents who were interested in using, or had used, Oqtant. In this study, we\ninvestigate instructors' views about reasons they would like to use Oqtant and\nchallenges they would face in doing so. We also provide a concrete example of\nhow Oqtant was used in an upper-division undergraduate quantum mechanics course\nand the instructor's perception of its benefits. We complement this with the\nstudent perspective, discussing student experiences interacting with Oqtant in\ntheir course or through think-aloud interviews outside of a course. These\nresults will help the community consider the potential value for students of\ncreating more opportunities to access remote quantum experiments.",

    "abstract":"The ratio between the stellar mass of a galaxy, $M_{*}$, and that of its\ncentral supermassive black hole (SMBH), $M_\\bullet$, the ``Magorrian''\nrelationship, traces their coevolution. JWST observations have suggested\nsignificant evolution in $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$ relative to local scaling\nrelationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z $\\ge$ 4. We test\nthis possibility by (1) determining the preferred $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$ scaling\nrelation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy\nstellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported\nevolution. We then apply Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational\nbiases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in\n$M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$ for z $\\ge$ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies\n($\\log(M_*\/M_{\\odot})<10$). However, similarly high values of $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$\nare also found in low mass galaxies at $z \\sim$ 0.5 to 3 that may be common at\ncosmic noon. Nonetheless, galaxies with similar behavior are rare locally and\nnot accounted for in the local scaling relations. In contrast, z $\\sim$ 6\nquasars can have $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$ well above the local relation value, but\nthey can be explained as extreme cases still within the scaling relation for\ntheir higher mass host galaxies. Black holes in some of them and in the\nlow-mass systems may be undergoing very high accretion episodes that result in\nhigh $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$ but that will be followed by quiescent periods when\ngrowth of the host drives the systems toward more typical $M_\\bullet\/M_{*}$\nvalues.",

    "abstract":"End-to-end human animation, such as audio-driven talking human generation,\nhas undergone notable advancements in the recent few years. However, existing\nmethods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models,\nlimiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose\nOmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by\nmixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we\nintroduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the\ncorresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable\nOmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving\nhighly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports\nvarious portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body),\nsupports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and\nchallenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to\nexisting end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more\nrealistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also\nsupports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined\ndriving signals).

Beyond extracting motion signals from source\nvideo, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional\ninputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of\ncharacters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while\nmaintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a\nshape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the\nrelationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the\nfidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract\nfeatures of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature\ninjection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model\nto handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method.",

    "abstract":"Boundary representation (B-rep) of geometric models is a fundamental format\nin Computer-Aided Design (CAD). However, automatically generating valid and\nhigh-quality B-rep models remains challenging due to the complex\ninterdependence between the topology and geometry of the models. Existing\nmethods tend to prioritize geometric representation while giving insufficient\nattention to topological constraints, making it difficult to maintain\nstructural validity and geometric accuracy. In this paper, we propose\nDTGBrepGen, a novel topology-geometry decoupled framework for B-rep generation\nthat explicitly addresses both aspects. Our approach first generates valid\ntopological structures through a two-stage process that independently models\nedge-face and edge-vertex adjacency relationships. Subsequently, we employ\nTransformer-based diffusion models for sequential geometry generation,\nprogressively generating vertex coordinates, followed by edge geometries and\nface geometries which are represented as B-splines. Extensive experiments on\ndiverse CAD datasets show that DTGBrepGen significantly outperforms existing\nmethods in both topological validity and geometric accuracy, achieving higher\nvalidity rates and producing more diverse and realistic B-reps.

    "abstract":"Deep learning is an effective end-to-end method for Polarimetric Synthetic\nAperture Radar(PolSAR) image classification, but it lacks the guidance of\nrelated mathematical principle and is essentially a black-box model. In\naddition, existing deep models learn features in Euclidean space, where PolSAR\ncomplex matrix is commonly converted into a complex-valued vector as the\nnetwork input, distorting matrix structure and channel relationship. However,\nthe complex covariance matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), and resides\non a Riemannian manifold instead of a Euclidean one. Existing methods cannot\nmeasure the geometric distance of HPD matrices and easily cause some\nmisclassifications due to inappropriate Euclidean measures. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel Riemannian Sparse Representation Learning Network\n(SRSR CNN) for PolSAR images. Firstly, a superpixel-based Riemannian Sparse\nRepresentation (SRSR) model is designed to learn the sparse features with\nRiemannian metric. Then, the optimization procedure of the SRSR model is\ninferred and further unfolded into an SRSRnet, which can automatically learn\nthe sparse coefficients and dictionary atoms. Furthermore, to learn contextual\nhigh-level features, a CNN-enhanced module is added to improve classification\nperformance. The proposed network is a Sparse Representation (SR) guided deep\nlearning model, which can directly utilize the covariance matrix as the network\ninput, and utilize Riemannian metric to learn geometric structure and sparse\nfeatures of complex matrices in Riemannian space. Experiments on three real\nPolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art\ntechniques in ensuring accurate edge details and correct region homogeneity for\nclassification.",

    "abstract":"Trajectory-based motion control has emerged as an intuitive and efficient\napproach for controllable video generation. However, the existing\ntrajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion\ntrajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions\nbetween the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video\ngeneration, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some\nobjects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the\ndynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion\ncontrol of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception\nmodule and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object\nperception module employs visual language models to capture the position and\ncategory information of various objects within the image. The\nChain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input\nand conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for\neach of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model\nfor video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction\n(VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video\ngeneration methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of\ninteractions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used\nfor accurate performance evaluation. Experimental results show that C-Drag\nachieves promising performance across multiple metrics, excelling in object\nmotion control. Our benchmark, codes, and models will be available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/WesLee88524\/C-Drag-Official-Repo.",

    "abstract":"Aims. We introduce the SISSI (Supernovae In a Stratified, Shearing\nInterstellar medium) simulation suite, which aims to enable a more\ncomprehensive understanding of supernova remnants (SNRs) evolving in a complex\ninterstellar medium (ISM) structured under the influence of galactic rotation,\ngravity and turbulence. Methods. We utilize zoom-in simulations of 30 SNRs\nexpanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy\nis resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\\sim 12\\,\\text{pc}$, while we\nachieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\\sim 0.18\\, \\text{pc}$ in the vicinity of\nthe explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and\ncompare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the\nearly stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical\nmodels. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital\ntimescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate\nor oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter\nthan the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear,\nsuggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the\nalignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations\nfrom said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related\norigin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it\nmight be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a\nstandard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the\ngeometry of SNRs can reveal valuable insights about the complex interactions\nshaping their dynamical evolution. Future studies targeting the geometry of\nGalactic SNRs may use this insight to obtain a clearer picture of the processes\nshaping the Galactic ISM.",

Current recommendation strategies grapple with two\nsignificant hurdles. Firstly, the future impacts of recommendation decisions\nremain obscured, rendering it impractical to evaluate them through direct\noptimization of immediate metrics. Secondly, conflicts often emerge between\nmultiple objectives, like enhancing accuracy versus exploring diverse\nrecommendations. Existing strategies, trapped in a \"training, evaluation, and\nretraining\" loop, grow more labor-intensive as objectives evolve. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce a future-conditioned strategy for\nmulti-objective controllable recommendations, allowing for the direct\nspecification of future objectives and empowering the model to generate item\nsequences that align with these goals autoregressively. We present the\nMulti-Objective Controllable Decision Transformer (MocDT), an offline\nReinforcement Learning (RL) model capable of autonomously learning the mapping\nfrom multiple objectives to item sequences, leveraging extensive offline data.\nConsequently, it can produce recommendations tailored to any specified\nobjectives during the inference stage.

In\nthis work, we report the observation of the non-Hermitian non-Abelian\ntopological transition at the atomic scale utilizing a nitrogenvacancy center\nin diamond. While the well-established topological numbers, failed to recognize\nthis transition, we successfully characterized such a transition with the\nmeasurement of the complex eigenvalue braids. We obtained the braid invariants\nfrom the measured relative phases between eigenvalues. The observed change in\nbraid invariants provides a clear signature of the non-Abelian topological\ntransition. Furthermore, we experimentally revealed an intriguing consequence\nof this transition, which is the creation of a third-order exceptional point\nthrough the collision of two second-order exceptional points with opposite\ncharges.

    "title":"A Unified Dual Consensus Approach to Distributed Optimization with\n  Globally-Coupled Constraints",
    "abstract":"This article explores distributed convex optimization with globally-coupled\nconstraints, where the objective function is a general nonsmooth convex\nfunction, the constraints include nonlinear inequalities and affine equalities,\nand the feasible region is possibly unbounded. To address such problems, a\nunified DUal Consensus Algorithm (DUCA) and its proximal variant (Pro-DUCA) are\nproposed, which are unified frameworks that approximate the method of\nmultipliers applied to the corresponding dual problem in no need of a\nclosed-form dual objective. With varied parameter settings, DUCA and Pro-DUCA\nnot only extend a collection of existing consensus optimization methods to\nsolve the dual problem that they used to be inapplicable to, but also aid in\noffering new efficient algorithms to the literature. The proposed unified\nalgorithms are shown to achieve $O(1\/k)$ convergence rates in terms of\noptimality and feasibility, providing new or enhanced convergence results for a\nnumber of existing methods. Simulations demonstrate that these algorithms\noutperform several state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of objective and\nfeasibility errors.",

    "abstract":"In an MPC-protected distributed computation, although the use of MPC assures\ndata privacy during computation, sensitive information may still be inferred by\ncurious MPC participants from the computation output. This can be observed, for\ninstance, in the inference attacks on either federated learning or a more\nstandard statistical computation with distributed inputs. In this work, we\naddress this output privacy issue by proposing a discrete and bounded\nLaplace-inspired perturbation mechanism along with a secure realization of this\nmechanism using MPC. The proposed mechanism strictly adheres to a zero failure\nprobability, overcoming the limitation encountered on other existing bounded\nand discrete variants of Laplace perturbation. We provide analyses of the\nproposed differential privacy (DP) perturbation in terms of its privacy and\nutility. Additionally, we designed MPC protocols to implement this mechanism\nand presented performance benchmarks based on our experimental setup. The MPC\nrealization of the proposed mechanism exhibits a complexity similar to the\nstate-of-the-art discrete Gaussian mechanism, which can be considered an\nalternative with comparable efficiency while providing stronger differential\nprivacy guarantee. Moreover, efficiency of the proposed scheme can be further\nenhanced by performing the noise generation offline while leaving the\nperturbation phase online.",

    "abstract":"Visual reasoning is central to human cognition, enabling individuals to\ninterpret and abstractly understand their environment. Although recent\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive\nperformance across language and vision-language tasks, existing benchmarks\nprimarily measure recognition-based skills and inadequately assess true visual\nreasoning capabilities. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce VERIFY, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate the visual\nreasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs. VERIFY compels models to\nreason primarily from visual information, providing minimal textual context to\nreduce reliance on domain-specific knowledge and linguistic biases. Each\nproblem is accompanied by a human-annotated reasoning path, making it the first\nto provide in-depth evaluation of model decision-making processes.\nAdditionally, we propose novel metrics that assess visual reasoning fidelity\nbeyond mere accuracy, highlighting critical imbalances in current model\nreasoning patterns. Our comprehensive benchmarking of leading MLLMs uncovers\nsignificant limitations, underscoring the need for a balanced and holistic\napproach to both perception and reasoning.

    "abstract":"HD93129A is an O+O stellar system whose CWR has been mapped by high angular\nresolution observations at cm wavelengths. The synchrotron nature of the radio\nemission confirms its particle accelerator status. According to astrometric\nmeasurements since 1996, the system has an orbital period of ~120 yr and\nrecently went through its periastron passage. We characterize the radio\nemission during the epoch of periastron passage, when the particle density and\nthe local magnetic energy density in the CWR increase. We monitored HD93129A\nand surroundings at 2.1, 5.5 and 9 GHz with the ATCA over 17 months, with a\n~2-month cadence. Previous ATCA data and data collected using other radio\nobservatories were also included. We obtained radio light curves in subbands\nper band per epoch. The flux densities show an average rise of a factor four\nfrom 2003 to 2018, with the caveat that the 2009-2018 time lapse is devoid of\ndata, and a similar decay between 2018 to 2020. We fit the spectral energy\ndistribution of quasi-simultaneous data at three epochs and find that the\nmagnetic-to-thermal pressure ratio does not remain constant along the orbit,\npossible suggesting magnetic field amplification close to periastron. In the\n2019 epoch, we estimate a magnetic field strength of ~1.1G in the apex of the\nCWR. The evolution of the SED and spectral index is also presented. By\ncombining ATCA and ASKAP images a spectral index map was obtained in an area of\n30' size. The radio emission in the direction of other massive binary systems\nin the field (WR22, WR25 and HD93250) was measured and briefly discussed.\nIntensive radio monitoring allows us to track the evolution of physical\nconditions in the shocks. The general trend of decreasing emission of HD93129A\nin the high-frequency bands in 2019-2020 suggests that the system is at\npost-periastron, consistent with model predictions. (Abridged)",

    "abstract":"We present GeoManip, a framework to enable generalist robots to leverage\nessential conditions derived from object and part relationships, as geometric\nconstraints, for robot manipulation. For example, cutting the carrot requires\nadhering to a geometric constraint: the blade of the knife should be\nperpendicular to the carrot's direction. By interpreting these constraints\nthrough symbolic language representations and translating them into low-level\nactions, GeoManip bridges the gap between natural language and robotic\nexecution, enabling greater generalizability across diverse even unseen tasks,\nobjects, and scenarios. Unlike vision-language-action models that require\nextensive training, operates training-free by utilizing large foundational\nmodels: a constraint generation module that predicts stage-specific geometric\nconstraints and a geometry parser that identifies object parts involved in\nthese constraints. A solver then optimizes trajectories to satisfy inferred\nconstraints from task descriptions and the scene. Furthermore, GeoManip learns\nin-context and provides five appealing human-robot interaction features:\non-the-fly policy adaptation, learning from human demonstrations, learning from\nfailure cases, long-horizon action planning, and efficient data collection for\nimitation learning. Extensive evaluations on both simulations and real-world\nscenarios demonstrate GeoManip's state-of-the-art performance, with superior\nout-of-distribution generalization while avoiding costly model training.",

    "abstract":"Self-superlubricity is a highly anticipated phenomenon where certain solid\npairs in contact, without lubricant, exhibit zero wear and virtually null\nstatic friction and coefficient of friction (CoF). We present the first\nexperimental observation of self-superlubricity in a microscale\nsingle-crystalline graphite flake in contact with a nanoscale-rough Au\nsubstrate, achieved when the applied normal pressure exceeds a critical\nthreshold. Theoretical analysis revealed that substrate roughness impedes full\ncontact at low pressures, but increasing the pressure induces a transition to\nfull contact, enabling self-superlubricity. We established a dimensionless\ncriterion for this critical pressure, further validated by observing\nself-superlubricity between graphite and an atomically smooth sapphire\nsubstrate without requiring additional pressure. This breakthrough introduces a\ntransformative principle for next-generation microsystems such as\nmicro\/nanoscale generators, motors, oscillators, sensors, etc., enabling\nreduced power consumption and extended operational lifetimes in applications\nsuch as 6G communication, humanoid robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles.",

    "abstract":"Time-varying random objects have been increasingly encountered in modern data\nanalysis. Moreover, in a substantial number of these applications, periodic\nbehavior of the random objects has been observed. We introduce a new, powerful\nscan statistic and corresponding test for the precise identification and\nlocalization of abrupt changes in the distribution of non-Euclidean random\nobjects with possibly periodic behavior. Our approach is nonparametric and\neffectively captures the entire distribution of these random objects.\nRemarkably, it operates with minimal tuning parameters, requiring only the\nspecification of cut-off intervals near endpoints, where change points are\nassumed not to occur. Our theoretical contributions include deriving the\nasymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of no\nchange points, establishing the consistency of the test in the presence of\nchange points under contiguous alternatives and providing rigorous guarantees\non the near-optimal consistency in estimating the number and locations of\nchange points, whether dealing with a single change point or multiple ones. We\ndemonstrate that the most competitive method currently in the literature for\nchange point detection in random objects is degraded by periodic behavior, as\nperiodicity leads to blurring of the changes that this procedure aims to\ndiscover. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the superior\npower and accuracy of our approach in both detecting change points and\npinpointing their locations, across scenarios involving both periodic and\nnonperiodic random objects. Our main application is to weighted networks,\nrepresented through graph Laplacians. The proposed method delivers highly\ninterpretable results, as evidenced by the identification of meaningful change\npoints in the New York City Citi Bike sharing system that align with\nsignificant historical events.",

We propose an efficient scheme for encoding an MO as a many-qubit\nstate from a Gaussian-type solution that can be obtained from a tractable\nsolver on a classical computer. We employ the discrete Lorentzian functions\n(LFs) as a fitting basis set, for which we maximize the fidelity to find the\noptimal Tucker-form state to represent a target MO. For $n_{\\mathrm{prod}}$\nthree-dimensional LFs, we provide the explicit circuit construction for the\nstate preparation involving $\\mathcal{O} (n_{\\mathrm{prod}})$ CNOT gates.\nFurthermore, we introduce a tensor decomposition technique to construct a\ncanonical-form state to approximate the Tucker-form state with controllable\naccuracy. Rank-$R$ decomposition reduces the CNOT gate count to $\\mathcal{O} (R\nn_{\\mathrm{prod}}^{1\/3}).$ We demonstrate via numerical simulations that the\nproposed scheme is a powerful tool for encoding MOs of various quantum chemical\nsystems, paving the way for first-quantized calculations using hundreds or more\nlogical qubits.",

    "title":"Tracing the cosmological origin of gas that fuels in situ star formation\n  in TNG50 galaxies",
    "abstract":"Based on their cosmological origin, the stars of a galaxy can be divided into\ntwo categories: those that enter through merger events (ex situ) and those born\nin the main progenitor (in situ). We used the TNG50 cosmological\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulation and its Lagrangian tracer particles to explore\nand quantify the origin of gas that ultimately forms the in situ stars of\ngalaxies. We tracked back the baryonic mass contributing to the $z=0$ in situ\nstellar populations of galaxies, studying trends in mass from dwarfs to\ngroup-scale halos. We find that more massive halos acquire this matter earlier\nthan lower-mass halos, reflecting an overall earlier assembly of their in situ\nstellar mass. Defining the Lagrangian half-mass radius R$_{\\rm L, 1\/2}$ of a\ngalaxy as the distance containing half of the mass that will form its in situ\nstars by $z=0$, we find that R$_{\\rm L, 1\/2}$ is larger for more massive halos\nat early times, reflecting larger \"in situ Lagrangian regions.\" However, the\ndependence of this radius on halo mass becomes flat at $z \\simeq 3$ and then\ninverts toward $z=0$. In addition, R$_{\\rm L, 1\/2}$ increases rapidly with\nredshift, surpassing the virial radii of halos at $z \\sim 2$. This marks the\ncosmic epoch at which most of the gas that eventually forms the in situ stars\nof galaxies leaves the intergalactic medium (IGM) and enters halos, a\ntransition that occurs earlier for more massive halos. The formation redshift\nof the in situ stellar component increases with halo mass, while the formation\nredshift of the dark matter halo decreases, indicative of a differential\nassembly history between these two components. Finally, we decomposed the $z=0$\nin situ stellar mass into its distinct modes of accretion. Smooth accretion\nfrom the IGM is the most important for low-mass galaxies, while mergers and\nsatellite-stripped gas become relevant and even dominant only for high-mass\ngalaxies.",

We prove a generalization of this theorem that\naccounts for the presence of a finite group action on $\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2)$.\nOur proof is independent of the classical theorem, so by considering the\ntrivial group action, we give a new proof of the classical theorem.\n  Specifically, we show that any finite group action on $\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2)$\nextends to a $\\textit{linearly parted}$ action on $\\natural^n(S^1\\times B^3)$\nand that any two such extensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic. Roughly, a\nlinearly parted action respects a decomposition into equivariant $0$-handles\nand $1$-handles, where, for each handle in the decomposition, its stabilizer\nacts linearly on that handle. The restriction to linearly parted actions is\nimportant, because there are infinitely many distinct nonlinear actions on\n$B^4$ with identical actions on $\\partial B^4$; these nonlinear actions give\nextensions of the same action on $\\partial B^4$ which are $\\textit{not}$\nequivariantly diffeomorphic.\n  We also prove a more general theorem: Every finite group action on\n$\\left(\\#^n(S^1\\times S^2),L\\right)$, with $L$ an invariant unlink, extends\nacross a pair $\\left(\\natural^n(S^1\\times B^3),\\mathcal{D}\\right)$, with\n$\\mathcal{D}$ an equivariantly boundary-parallel disk-tangle, and any two such\nextensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic.",

We employ light-scanning-tunneling microscopy\n(light-STM) to investigate photon-induced currents on a single open-shell PTCDA\nanion molecule placed into a plasmonic nanocavity between a tip and a\nsubstrate, irradiated by laser. Submolecular mapping reveals a zero-bias\nbidirectional photocurrent strongly varying with the lateral position of the\ntip apex above the molecule. We elucidate the mechanism in terms of a\ntheoretical model in which a multiconfigurational doublet state is excited and\ndecays back to the anion ground state through sequential electron transfers\nwith the tip and the substrate. The correspondence of the experimental and\ntheoretical contrast proves the correlated character of the excited state which\ncan be described as a superposition of two dominating electronic\nconfigurations. By applying bipolar voltage on the junction with the molecule,\nwe switch the dominant recombination pathway from one of the configurations to\nthe other, effectively disentangling the multiconfigurational state individual\ncomponents through visualization of their Dyson orbitals, as corroborated by\ntheoretical modelling.",

(2) Poly-LSM utilizes an adaptive mechanism to handle edge\ninsertions and deletions on graphs with optimized I\/O efficiency. (3) Poly-LSM\nexploits the skewness of graph data to encode the key-value entries. Building\nupon this foundation, we further implement Aster, a robust and versatile graph\ndatabase that supports Gremlin query language facilitating various graph\napplications. In our experiments, we compared Aster against several mainstream\nreal-world graph databases. The results demonstrate that Aster outperforms all\nbaseline graph databases, especially on large-scale graphs. Notably, on the\nbillion-scale Twitter graph dataset, Aster achieves up to 17x throughput\nimprovement compared to the best-performing baseline graph system.",

    "abstract":"Object manipulation for rearrangement into a specific goal state is a\nsignificant task for collaborative robots. Accurately determining object\nplacement is a key challenge, as misalignment can increase task complexity and\nthe risk of collisions, affecting the efficiency of the rearrangement process.\nMost current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model\nfor predicting the goal position. As a result, these methods are restricted to\nspecific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and\ngeneralisation.

Our approach mimics human reasoning by making use of successful past\nexperiences as a reference to infer the best strategies to achieve a current\ndesired goal position.

    "abstract":"Transparent objects are prevalent in everyday environments, but their\ndistinct physical properties pose significant challenges for camera-guided\nrobotic arms. Current research is mainly dependent on camera-only approaches,\nwhich often falter in suboptimal conditions, such as low-light environments. In\nresponse to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion\nsystem tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp\nexploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals,\nwhich causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the\nprecise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar\nimages of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep\nneural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth\ncompletion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless,\ntraining FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image\ndatasets for transparent objects. We address this issue utilizing large RGB-D\ndataset, and propose an effective two-stage training approach: we first\npre-train FuseGrasp on a large public RGB-D dataset of transparent objects,\nthen fine-tune it on a self-built small RGB-D-Radar dataset. Furthermore, as a\nbyproduct, FuseGrasp can determine the composition of transparent objects, such\nas glass or plastic, leveraging the material identification capability of\nmmWave radar. This identification result facilitates the robotic arm in\nmodulating its grip force appropriately. Extensive testing reveals that\nFuseGrasp significantly improves the accuracy of depth reconstruction and\nmaterial identification for transparent objects. Moreover, real-world robotic\ntrials have confirmed that FuseGrasp markedly enhances the handling of\ntransparent items. A video demonstration of FuseGrasp is available at\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/MWDqv0sRSok.",

    "abstract":"In the domain of audio-visual event perception, which focuses on the temporal\nlocalization and classification of events across distinct modalities (audio and\nvisual), existing approaches are constrained by the vocabulary available in\ntheir training data. This limitation significantly impedes their capacity to\ngeneralize to novel, unseen event categories. Furthermore, the annotation\nprocess for this task is labor-intensive, requiring extensive manual labeling\nacross modalities and temporal segments, limiting the scalability of current\nmethods. Current state-of-the-art models ignore the shifts in event\ndistributions over time, reducing their ability to adjust to changing video\ndynamics. Additionally, previous methods rely on late fusion to combine audio\nand visual information. While straightforward, this approach results in a\nsignificant loss of multimodal interactions. To address these challenges, we\npropose Audio-Visual Adaptive Video Analysis ($\\text{AV}^2\\text{A}$), a\nmodel-agnostic approach that requires no further training and integrates a\nscore-level fusion technique to retain richer multimodal interactions.\n$\\text{AV}^2\\text{A}$ also includes a within-video label shift algorithm,\nleveraging input video data and predictions from prior frames to dynamically\nadjust event distributions for subsequent frames.

    "abstract":"Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and coherent control of light-matter interactions\n(through synchronized multiple coherent incident waves) are profound and\npervasive concepts in and beyond photonics, making accessible photonic\nmanipulations with extreme precision and efficiency. Though each has been\nplaying essential roles in its own, these two sweeping concepts remain largely\nsegregated with little interactions, blocking vast opportunities of\ncross-fertilization to explore. Here we unify both concepts into a novel\nframework of coherent control for light interacting with open photonic systems.\nFrom the QNM perspective, scattered waves are superimposed radiations from all\nQNMs excited, and thus coherent controls can be mapped into another problem of\nQNM excitation manipulations. Within our framework, all incident properties\n(amplitudes, phases and polarizations) of waves from different directions can\nbe exploited simultaneously in a synchronous manner, facilitating independent\nmanipulations of each QNM and thus unlocking enormous flexibilities for\ncoherent controls of both scattering intensity and polarization: (i) A visible\nstructure under a single incident wave can be made invisible through shining\nextra waves; (ii) Along a direction where QNMs' radiation polarizations are\nidentical, scattering along this direction can be fully eliminated, thus\ngeneralizing Kerker effects from a distinct QNM perspective; (iii) Along a\ndirection of distinct QNM radiation polarizations, arbitrary scattering\npolarizations can be obtained. Given the ubiquity and profundity of QNMs and\ncoherent control in almost all branches of wave physics, our framework and its\nunderlying principles will inspire further fundamental explorations and\npractical applications beyond photonics, opening new opportunities for various\nforms of wave-matter interactions.",

To address these limitations, we introduce\nFindTrack, a novel decoupled framework that separates target identification\nfrom mask propagation. FindTrack first adaptively selects a key frame by\nbalancing segmentation confidence and vision-text alignment, establishing a\nrobust reference for the target object. This reference is then utilized by a\ndedicated propagation module to track and segment the object across the entire\nvideo. By decoupling these processes, FindTrack effectively reduces ambiguities\nin target association and enhances segmentation consistency.

    "abstract":"Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an important method to enhance the\nlimited sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using the existing\nmechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve\nsignificant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field.\nThe recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange\ninteraction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable\nsignal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between\nthe biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the\ncurrent JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron\npolarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is\nassociated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power\nmicrowave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization\nimbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here,\nwe propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced\nsinglet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet\nexcitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet\ncross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead\nto the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This\ncommunication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as\nthe polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to\nenhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.",

This letter proposes a novel waveform\ndesign for joint sensing and communication (JSAC) systems, combining\nsingle-carrier interleaved frequency division multiplexing (SC-IFDM), a 5G\ncommunication candidate signal, with frequency modulated continuous wave\n(FMCW), widely used for sensing. The proposed waveform leverages the sparse\nnature of FMCW within SC-IFDM to achieve orthogonal integration in three steps:\nSC-IFDM symbols are allocated alongside the sparse FMCW, followed by the\nSC-IFDM transform into the time domain, and a cyclic prefix (CP) is applied in\nwhich phase shifts are introduced to the FMCW. Additionally, an enhanced\nchannel estimation method is incorporated to boost system performance.\nSimulation results demonstrate the proposed waveform's ability to deliver\nhigh-resolution sensing and superior communication performance, surpassing\ntraditional multicarrier designs.",

    "title":"Context-Aware Hierarchical Merging for Long Document Summarization",
    "abstract":"Hierarchical Merging is a technique commonly used to summarize very long\ntexts ($>$100K tokens) by breaking down the input into smaller sections,\nsummarizing those sections individually, and then merging or combining those\nsummaries into a final coherent summary. Although it helps address the\nlimitations of large language models (LLMs) with fixed input length\nconstraints, the recursive merging process can amplify LLM hallucinations,\nincreasing the risk of factual inaccuracies. In this paper, we seek to mitigate\nhallucinations by enriching hierarchical merging with context from the source\ndocument. Specifically, we propose different approaches to contextual\naugmentation ranging from \\emph{replacing} intermediate summaries with relevant\ninput context, to \\emph{refining} them while using the context as supporting\nevidence, and \\emph{aligning} them implicitly (via citations) to the input.\nExperimental results on datasets representing legal and narrative domains show\nthat contextual augmentation consistently outperforms zero-shot and\nhierarchical merging baselines for the Llama 3.1 model family. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that refinement methods tend to perform best when paired with\nextractive summarization for identifying relevant input.",

    "abstract":"Correlated behaviours between the radio emission and the X-ray emission in\nGalactic black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) in the X-ray hard state are\ncrucial to the understanding of disc-jet coupling of accreting black holes. The\nBH transient 4U 1543-47 went into outburst in 2021 following ~19 years of\nquiescence. We followed it up with ~weekly cadence with MeerKAT for about one\nyear and a half until it faded into quiescence. Multi-epoch quasi-simultaneous\nMeerKAT and X-ray observations allowed us to trace the compact jet emission and\nits X-ray emission. In its hard spectral state across three orders of magnitude\nof X-ray luminosities above ~10$^{34}$ ergs\/s, we found the correlation between\nradio and X-ray emission had a power-law index of 0.82$\\pm$0.09, steeper than\nthe canonical value of ~0.6 for BH XRBs. In addition, the radio vs. X-ray\ncorrelation shows a large range of the power-law normalization, with the\nmaximum significantly larger than that obtained for most BH XRBs, indicating it\ncan be particularly radio-bright and variable in the X-ray binary sample. The\nradio emission is unlikely diluted by discrete jet components. The observed\npeculiar radio-bright and variable behaviours provide the evidence for the\nrelativistic effects of a variable Lorentz factor in the range between 1 and ~2\nof the compact jet.",

    "title":"Dynamic Low-Rank Sparse Adaptation for Large Language Models",
    "abstract":"Despite the efficacy of network sparsity in alleviating the deployment strain\nof Large Language Models (LLMs), it endures significant performance\ndegradation. Applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the sparse LLMs\noffers an intuitive approach to counter this predicament, while it holds\nshortcomings include: 1) The inability to integrate LoRA weights into sparse\nLLMs post-training, and 2) Insufficient performance recovery at high sparsity\nratios. In this paper, we introduce dynamic Low-rank Sparse Adaptation (LoSA),\na novel method that seamlessly integrates low-rank adaptation into LLM sparsity\nwithin a unified framework, thereby enhancing the performance of sparse LLMs\nwithout increasing the inference latency. In particular, LoSA dynamically\nsparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during\nfine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the\nsparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual\nInformation (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers,\nthereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during\nfine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based\non the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an\nappropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies\nbetween dense and sparse LLMs. Extensive experiments tell that LoSA can\nefficiently boost the efficacy of sparse LLMs within a few hours, without\nintroducing any additional inferential burden. For example, LoSA reduced the\nperplexity of sparse LLaMA-2-7B by 68.73 and increased zero-shot accuracy by\n16.32$\\%$, achieving a 2.60$\\times$ speedup on CPU and 2.23$\\times$ speedup on\nGPU, requiring only 45 minutes of fine-tuning on a single NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU.\nCode is available at https:\/\/github.com\/wzhuang-xmu\/LoSA.",

To overcome this limitation, here we propose a new\nclass of time photonic crystals presenting chiral symmetry instead, whose edge\nstates exhibit superior robustness over the time-reversal-symmetry-protected\ncounterparts. Our time photonic crystal is equivalent to a temporal version of\nthe Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the chiral symmetry of this type of time\nphotonic crystals quantizes the winding number defined in the Bloch frequency\nband. Remarkably, random temporal disorders do not impact the eigenfrequencies\nof these chiral-symmetry-protected edge states, while instead enhancing their\ntemporal localizations. Our findings thus provide a promising paradigm to\ncontrol field amplification with exceptional robustness as well as being a\nfeasible platform to investigate various topological phases in time-varying\nmedia.",

    "abstract":"CONTEXT. Attack treesare a recommended threat modeling tool, but there is no\nestablished method to compare them. OBJECTIVE. We aim to establish a method to\ncompare \"real\" attack trees, based on both the structure of the tree itself and\nthe meaning of the node labels. METHOD. We define four methods of comparison\n(three novel and one established) and compare them to a dataset of attack trees\ncreated from a study run on students (n = 39). These attack trees all follow\nfrom the same scenario, but have slightly different labels. RESULTS. We find\nthat applying semantic similarity as a means of comparing node labels is a\nvalid approach. Further, we find that treeedit distance (established) and\nradical distance (novel) are themost promising methods of comparison in most\ncircumstances. CONCLUSION. We show that these two methods are valid as means of\ncomparing attack trees, and suggest a novel technique for using semantic\nsimilarity to compare node labels. We further suggest that these methods can be\nused to compare attack trees in a real-world scenario, and that they can be\nused to identify similar attack trees.",

    "title":"Improved 3D Point-Line Mapping Regression for Camera Relocalization",
    "abstract":"In this paper, we present a new approach for improving 3D point and line\nmapping regression for camera re-localization. Previous methods typically rely\non feature matching (FM) with stored descriptors or use a single network to\nencode both points and lines. While FM-based methods perform well in\nlarge-scale environments, they become computationally expensive with a growing\nnumber of mapping points and lines. Conversely, approaches that learn to encode\nmapping features within a single network reduce memory footprint but are prone\nto overfitting, as they may capture unnecessary correlations between points and\nlines. We propose that these features should be learned independently, each\nwith a distinct focus, to achieve optimal accuracy. To this end, we introduce a\nnew architecture that learns to prioritize each feature independently before\ncombining them for localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly enhances the 3D map point and line regression\nperformance for camera re-localization.

In the presence of a transverse magnetic field,\nHartmann and Shercliff layers are present on the walls orthogonal and parallel\nto the field direction, respectively. We assume reflection symmetries in both\ntransverse directions, and investigate the competition between transition\nmechanisms specific to each boundary layer using direct numerical simulations.\nIndependently of which wall turbulence eventually occupies, transition relies\nexclusively on a tripping of the Shercliff layer by perturbations, while the\nHartmann layer plays a passive role. This is explained, using a dynamical\nsystems interpretation, by the spatial localization of the edge states in the\nShercliff layer at the expense of the Hartmann layer.

    "abstract":"Objective: This study aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two\nJapanese language models-conventional Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) and the newer ModernBERT-in classifying findings from\nchest CT reports, with a focus on tokenization efficiency, processing time, and\nclassification performance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using\nthe CT-RATE-JPN dataset containing 22,778 training reports and 150 test\nreports. Both models were fine-tuned for multi-label classification of 18\ncommon chest CT conditions. The training data was split in 18,222:4,556 for\ntraining and validation. Performance was evaluated using F1 scores for each\ncondition and exact match accuracy across all 18 labels. Results: ModernBERT\ndemonstrated superior tokenization efficiency, requiring 24.0% fewer tokens per\ndocument (258.1 vs. 339.6) compared to BERT Base. This translated to\nsignificant performance improvements, with ModernBERT completing training in\n1877.67 seconds versus BERT's 3090.54 seconds (39% reduction). ModernBERT\nprocessed 38.82 samples per second during training (1.65x faster) and 139.90\nsamples per second during inference (1.66x faster). Despite these efficiency\ngains, classification performance remained comparable, with ModernBERT\nachieving superior F1 scores in 8 conditions, while BERT performed better in 4\nconditions. Overall exact match accuracy was slightly higher for ModernBERT\n(74.67% vs. 72.67%), though this difference was not statistically significant\n(p=0.6291). Conclusion: ModernBERT offers substantial improvements in\ntokenization efficiency and training speed without sacrificing classification\nperformance. These results suggest that ModernBERT is a promising candidate for\nclinical applications in Japanese radiology reports analysis.",

Additionally, we explore the effect\nof document-level context on refinement under the context-aware fine-tuning\nscenario. Experimental results on the MuST-C and CoVoST 2 datasets, which\ninclude seven translation tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach using several popular LLMs including GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B, and\nMistral-12B. Further analysis further suggests that jointly refining both\ntranscription and translation yields better performance compared to refining\ntranslation alone. Meanwhile, incorporating document-level context\nsignificantly enhances refinement performance. We release our code and datasets\non GitHub.",

    "abstract":"SN~2022pul gains special attention due to its possible origin of a\nsuper-Chandarsekhar-mass white dwarf explosion (or called a 03fg-like type Ia\nsupernova), which shows prominent [O\\,{\\sc i}], [Ne\\,{\\sc i}], and [Ca\\,{\\sc\nii}] lines in its late-time spectra taken at $\\sim+$300 days after the peak\nbrightness. In this paper, we present new optical observations for this\npeculiar object, extending up to over 500 days after the peak brightness. In\nparticular, in the $t\\approx+515$ days spectrum, we identified for the first\ntime the presence of narrow emission from [C\\,{\\sc i}] $\\lambda\\lambda9824,\n9850$, which appears asymmetric and quite similar to the accompanied [O\\,{\\sc\ni}] $\\lambda6300$ line in strength and profile. Based on the violent merger\nmodel that accounts well for previous observations but leaves little carbon in\nthe center of the ejecta, this carbon line can be reproduced by increasing the\ndegree of clumping in the ejecta and setting the carbon mass the same as that\nof oxygen ($\\sim$0.06 $M_{\\odot}$) in the innermost region ($\\lesssim 2000$ km\ns$^{-1}$). In principle, the central carbon could come from the secondary white\ndwarf (WD) if it is ignited when hit by the shockwave of the explosion of the\nprimary WD and explodes as a Ca-rich supernova, whereas pure deflagration of a\nsuper-Chandarsekhar-mass WD can account for such unburnt carbon more naturally.",

The interictal methods are\nproposed to assist in presurgical planning with simpler data acquisition and\nhigher speed.

This method is based on spatiotemporal independent\ncomponent analysis on rsfMRI with a component-sorting procedure upon dominant\npower frequency, biophysical constraints, spatial lateralization, local\nconnectivity, temporal energy, and functional non-Gaussianity. This method\nutilized the rs-fMRI potential to reach a high spatial accuracy in localizing\nepileptic foci from interictal data while retaining the reliability of results\nfor clinical usage. Thirteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent\nsurgical resection and had seizure-free surgical outcomes after a 12-month\nfollow-up were included in this study. All patients had presurgical structural\nMRI and rsfMRI while postsurgical MRI images were available for ten.

Our analysis focuses\non the impact of VSR on the Cherenkov angle, revealing modifications to the\ndispersion relation of particles, particularly the photon and the electron,\nwhich acquire an effective inertial mass. This modification also implies a\ndeviation in the speed of light, which can be constrained through precise\nexperimental measurements. Using data from the RICH system of the LHCb\nexperiment, we take advantage of its capability to reconstruct Cherenkov angles\nwithin the momentum range of the particles of 2.6-100 GeV\/c. These\nmeasurements, combined with the most stringent laboratory tests of the isotropy\nof the speed of light ($\\Delta c \/ c \\sim 10^{-17}$), allow us to impose new\nupper bounds on the parameter $\\Omega$, which quantifies a deviation from the\nstandard Special Relativity. Furthermore, we establish an analogy between VSR\nand Minkowski's electrodynamics in a dielectric medium for particles with very\nhigh velocity, offering a physically intuitive interpretation of the parameter\n$\\Omega$.",

    "abstract":"The simplest inflationary models predict the primordial power spectrum (PPS)\nof curvature perturbations to be nearly scale-invariant. However, various other\nmodels of inflation predict deviations from this behaviour, motivating a\ndata-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this\nwork, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to\nreconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators\nfor fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging\ngradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our\napproach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of\ncosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on\nboth. Applying this framework to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\ntemperature anisotropy data we find our reconstructed PPS to be consistent with\nnear scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at\nlarge scales, driven mostly by cosmic variance. Our results show an\noverestimation of the PPS amplitude compared to $\\Lambda$CDM predictions from\nthe Planck 2018 analysis, which we attribute to our choice of a conservative\nprior on the optical depth $\\tau$ based on Planck 2015 measurements. Adopting a\nprior consistent with Planck 2018 measurements brings our results into full\nagreement with previous work. To ensure robustness of our results, we validate\nour differentiable pipeline against a non-differentiable framework, and also\ndemonstrate that our results are insensitive to the choice of Gaussian process\nhyperparameters. These promising results and the flexibility of our pipeline\nmake it ideally suited for application to additional data sets such as CMB\npolarisation as well as Large-Scale Structure probes, thus moving towards\nmulti-probe primordial power spectrum reconstruction.",

    "abstract":"The co-design of neural network architectures, quantization precisions, and\nhardware accelerators offers a promising approach to achieving an optimal\nbalance between performance and efficiency, particularly for model deployment\non resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we propose the JAQ\nFramework, which jointly optimizes the three critical dimensions. However,\neffectively automating the design process across the vast search space of those\nthree dimensions poses significant challenges, especially when pursuing\nextremely low-bit quantization. Specifical, the primary challenges include: (1)\nMemory overhead in software-side: Low-precision quantization-aware training can\nlead to significant memory usage due to storing large intermediate features and\nlatent weights for back-propagation, potentially causing memory exhaustion. (2)\nSearch time-consuming in hardware-side: The discrete nature of hardware\nparameters and the complex interplay between compiler optimizations and\nindividual operators make the accelerator search time-consuming. To address\nthese issues, JAQ mitigates the memory overhead through a channel-wise sparse\nquantization (CSQ) scheme, selectively applying quantization to the most\nsensitive components of the model during optimization. Additionally, JAQ\ndesigns BatchTile, which employs a hardware generation network to encode all\npossible tiling modes, thereby speeding up the search for the optimal compiler\nmapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JAQ,\nachieving approximately 7% higher Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet compared to\nprevious methods and reducing the hardware search time per iteration to 0.15\nseconds.",

    "title":"Deep Assessment of Code Review Generation Approaches: Beyond Lexical\n  Similarity",
    "abstract":"Code review is a standard practice for ensuring the quality of software\nprojects, and recent research has focused extensively on automated code review.\nWhile significant advancements have been made in generating code reviews, the\nautomated assessment of these reviews remains less explored, with existing\napproaches and metrics often proving inaccurate. Current metrics, such as BLEU,\nprimarily rely on lexical similarity between generated and reference reviews.\nHowever, such metrics tend to underestimate reviews that articulate the\nexpected issues in ways different from the references. In this paper, we\nexplore how semantic similarity between generated and reference reviews can\nenhance the automated assessment of code reviews. We first present a benchmark\ncalled \\textit{GradedReviews}, which is constructed by collecting real-world\ncode reviews from open-source projects, generating reviews using\nstate-of-the-art approaches, and manually assessing their quality. We then\nevaluate existing metrics for code review assessment using this benchmark,\nrevealing their limitations. To address these limitations, we propose two novel\nsemantic-based approaches for assessing code reviews. The first approach\ninvolves converting both the generated review and its reference into digital\nvectors using a deep learning model and then measuring their semantic\nsimilarity through Cosine similarity. The second approach generates a prompt\nbased on the generated review and its reference, submits this prompt to\nChatGPT, and requests ChatGPT to rate the generated review according to\nexplicitly defined criteria. Our evaluation on the \\textit{GradedReviews}\nbenchmark indicates that the proposed semantic-based approaches significantly\noutperform existing state-of-the-art metrics in assessing generated code\nreview, improving the correlation coefficient between the resulting scores and\nhuman scores from 0.22 to 0.47.",

    "abstract":"Membrane distillation (MD) stands at the forefront of desalination\ntechnology, harnessing the power of phase change to separate water vapor from\nsaline using minimal energy resources efficiently. In response to this\nchallenge, membranes with tuned pores morphology and surface chemistry with\nbiomimetic 3D pine-like structures with improved affinity to water\n(desalination) and\/or hazardous VOC (VOC removal) were developed and studied\nsystematically. By implementing VIPS-PVDF membranes and a green modifier of\n1-adamantanamine for the first time, membranes with a revolutionary network\narchitecture were generated. The modifier was introduced either physically to\nthe polymeric matrix or chemically through covalent attachment onto the surface\nand inside the porous structure. As a result, membranes that defy wetting under\nextreme hydrostatic pressures (>11.5 bar) were produced while preserving\nunparalleled vapor transport efficiency. The 1-adamantanamine promotes\ntransport and enhances the affinity to the VOC, ensuring excellent membrane\nperformance at different applications of the MD process. Transport was enhanced\nmore than 3.6 times and separation factor beta changed from 3.48 to 15.22 for\nMTBE removal and from 2.0 to 3.46 for EtOH removal when comparing pristine PVDF\nwith membrane chemically modified with 1-adamantanamine (PVDF_Ch02). The\nprocess separation index during the MTBE removal changed from 20 kg m-2 h-1\n(PVDF) to 297 kg m-2 h-1 (PVDF_Ch02). All materials were highly stable and\ndurable during the MD applications. This innovative approach not only\nrevolutionizes desalination but also holds immense promise for diverse\napplications beyond, particularly in the realm of wastewater treatment. A study\nof the icing process on a cold plate with new membranes provided deeper insight\ninto the icing mechanism and the role of membrane LEP in it.",

    "abstract":"Researchers often lack the resources to test every hypothesis of interest\ndirectly or compute test statistics comprehensively, but often possess\nauxiliary data from which we can compute an estimate of the experimental\noutcome. We introduce a novel approach for selecting which hypotheses to query\na statistic (i.e., run an experiment, perform expensive computation, etc.) in a\nhypothesis testing setup by leveraging estimates (e.g., from experts, machine\nlearning models, previous experiments, etc.) to compute proxy statistics. Our\nframework allows a scientist to propose a proxy statistic, and then query the\ntrue statistic with some probability based on the value of the proxy. We make\nno assumptions about how the proxy is derived and it can be arbitrarily\ndependent with the true statistic. If the true statistic is not queried, the\nproxy is used in its place. We characterize \"active\" methods that produce valid\np-values and e-values in this setting and utilize this framework in the\nmultiple testing setting to create procedures with false discovery rate (FDR)\ncontrol. Through simulations and real data analysis of causal effects in\nscCRISPR screen experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our proxy\nframework has both high power and low resource usage when our proxies are\naccurate estimates of the respective true statistics.",

    "abstract":"Radioguided surgery, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, relies on the\nprecise localization of radioactive targets by non-imaging gamma\/beta\ndetectors. Manual radioactive target detection based on visual display or\naudible indication of gamma level is highly dependent on the ability of the\nsurgeon to track and interpret the spatial information. This paper presents a\nlearning-based method to realize the autonomous radiotracer detection in\nrobot-assisted surgeries by navigating the probe to the radioactive target. We\nproposed novel hybrid approach that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nwith adaptive robotic scanning. The adaptive grid-based scanning could provide\ninitial direction estimation while the DRL-based agent could efficiently\nnavigate to the target utilising historical data. Simulation experiments\ndemonstrate a 95% success rate, and improved efficiency and robustness compared\nto conventional techniques. Real-world evaluation on the da Vinci Research Kit\n(dVRK) further confirms the feasibility of the approach, achieving an 80%\nsuccess rate in radiotracer detection.

It is a common pitfall in\nlongitudinal studies, particularly in settings where treatment assignment is\nconfounded. In this paper, I highlight the drawbacks of one of the most popular\nidentification strategies in such settings: Difference-in-Differences (DiD).\nSpecifically, I employ principal stratification analysis to show that the\nconventional ATT estimand may not be well defined, and the DiD estimand cannot\nbe interpreted causally without additional assumptions. To address these\nissues, I develop an identification strategy to partially identify causal\neffects on the subset of units with well-defined and observed outcomes under\nboth treatment regimes. I adapt Lee bounds to the Changes-in-Changes (CiC)\nsetting (Athey & Imbens, 2006), leveraging the time dimension of the data to\nrelax the unconfoundedness assumption in the original trimming strategy of Lee\n(2009). This setting has the DiD identification strategy as a particular case,\nwhich I also implement in the paper. Additionally, I explore how to leverage\nmultiple sources of sample selection to relax the monotonicity assumption in\nLee (2009), which may be of independent interest.

Once\nalerts are triggered, Site Reliability Engineers delve into detailed data\nacross various modalities such as metrics, logs, and traces - to diagnose\nsystem issues. However, defining an optimal set of alerts is increasingly\nchallenging due to the sheer volume of multi-modal observability data points in\nlarge cloud-native systems. Typically, alerts are manually curated, primarily\ndefined on the metrics modality, and heavily reliant on subject matter experts\nmanually navigating through the large state-space of intricate relationships in\nmulti-modal observability data.

First, we\nstudy realizability of cycle scenarios with multi-qubit Pauli observables: we\nshow that the maximum size of a cycle faithfully realizable by $m$-qubit Paulis\nis upper bounded by $3m$, while we construct explicit realizations of cycles of\nsize $2m-1$ or $2m$, depending on whether $m \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ or $m\n\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. Then, we investigate the presence of contextuality: we\nprove that no $n$-cycle Pauli realization for $n > 4$ can witness contextuality\n(on any quantum state), whereas for $n = 4$ every Pauli realization exhibits\ncontextuality, attaining the quantum bound for all noncontextuality\ninequalities on some pure state. Finally, we discuss arbitrary Pauli scenarios\nin light of Vorob'ev's theorem, and show that, contrary to what our cycle\ncharacterization might suggest, the presence of $4$-cycles is not necessary for\nwitnessing contextuality in general Pauli scenarios.",

    "abstract":"We present SwD, a scale-wise distillation framework for diffusion models\n(DMs), which effectively employs next-scale prediction ideas for\ndiffusion-based few-step generators. In more detail, SwD is inspired by the\nrecent insights relating diffusion processes to the implicit spectral\nautoregression. We suppose that DMs can initiate generation at lower data\nresolutions and gradually upscale the samples at each denoising step without\nloss in performance while significantly reducing computational costs. SwD\nnaturally integrates this idea into existing diffusion distillation methods\nbased on distribution matching. Also, we enrich the family of distribution\nmatching approaches by introducing a novel patch loss enforcing finer-grained\nsimilarity to the target distribution. When applied to state-of-the-art\ntext-to-image diffusion models, SwD approaches the inference times of two full\nresolution steps and significantly outperforms the counterparts under the same\ncomputation budget, as evidenced by automated metrics and human preference\nstudies.",

    "title":"MTLoc: A Confidence-Based Source-Free Domain Adaptation Approach For\n  Indoor Localization",
    "abstract":"Various deep learning models have been developed for indoor localization\nbased on radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, they often\nrequire adaptation to ensure accurate tracking in new target operational\ndomains. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)\nmethods have been proposed to align pre-trained models with data from target\nenvironments. However, they rely on large annotated datasets from the initial\ndomain (source). Source data access is limited by privacy, storage,\ncomputational, and transfer constraints. Although many source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods address these constraints in classification, applying\nthem to regression models for localization remains challenging. Indeed, target\ndatasets for indoor localization are typically small, with few features and\nsamples, and are noisy. Adapting regression models requires high-confidence\ntarget pseudo-annotation to avoid over-training. In this paper, a specialized\nmean-teacher method called MTLoc is proposed for SFDA. MTLoc updates the\nstudent network using noisy data and teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The\nteacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To\nfurther ensure robustness, the teacher's pseudo-labels are refined using\nk-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on\ntarget data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor\nenvironments. Validated using real-world data from our experimental setup with\nINLAN Inc., our results show that MTLoc achieves high localization accuracy\nunder challenging conditions, significantly reducing localization error\ncompared to baselines, including the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA approach\nwith access to source data.",

    "abstract":"Context: Microservice-based systems have established themselves in the\nsoftware industry. However, sustainability-related legislation and the growing\ncosts of energy-hungry software increase the importance of energy efficiency\nfor these systems. While some proposals for architectural tactics and patterns\nexist, their effectiveness as well as potential trade-offs on other quality\nattributes (QAs) remain unclear.\n  Goal: We therefore aim to study the effectiveness of microservices tactics\nand patterns to reduce energy consumption, as well as potential trade-offs with\nperformance and maintainability.\n  Method: Using the open-source Online Boutique system, we conducted a\ncontrolled experiment with three tactics and three patterns, and analyzed the\nimpact of each technique compared to a baseline. We also tested with three\nlevels of simulated request loads (low, medium, high).\n  Results: Request load moderated the effectiveness of reducing energy\nconsumption. All techniques (tactics and patterns) reduced the energy\nconsumption for at least one load level, up to 5.6%. For performance, the\ntechniques could negatively impact response time by increasing it by up to\n25.9%, while some also decreased it by up to 72.5%. Two techniques increased\nthe throughput, by 1.9% and 34.0%. For maintainability, three techniques had a\nnegative, one a positive, and two no impact.\n  Conclusion: Some techniques reduced energy consumption while also improving\nperformance. However, these techniques usually involved a trade-off in\nmaintainability, e.g., via more code duplication and module coupling. Overall,\nall techniques significantly reduced energy consumption at higher loads, but\nmost of them sacrificed one of the other QAs. This highlights that the real\nchallenge is not simply reducing energy consumption of microservices, but to\nachieve energy efficiency.",

    "title":"Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet",
    "abstract":"The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the\nfield of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to\nlearn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For\nlow-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the\nscarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the\nmodels' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation\nperformance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a\nquest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an\nempirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for\nboosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic\nfine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data;\n(ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the\nLLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot\nexamples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a\npre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and\nlow-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages\n(R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our\nfindings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs,\npossibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their\nlimited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models,\nin-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and\ncheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently,\nvery large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages\nwhen fine-tuning is performed, possibly due to the lack of enough data needed\nto effectively update their weights.",

    "abstract":"The stories and characters that captivate us as we grow up shape unique\nfantasy worlds, with images serving as the primary medium for visually\nexperiencing these realms. Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning\nwith theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image\ngeneration. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning\nspecific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such\nas characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key\nchallenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and\ncontinuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often\ncome with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of\noverfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation\nmodels directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large\nlanguage models use text as context? To address this, we present T-Prompter, a\nnovel training-free TSI method for generation. T-Prompter introduces visual\nprompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models,\nallowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring\nadditional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic\nVisual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to\nimprove the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables\ndiverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design,\nrealistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative\nevaluations against state-of-the-art personalization methods demonstrate that\nT-Prompter achieves significantly better results and excels in maintaining\ncharacter identity preserving, style consistency and text alignment, offering a\nrobust and flexible solution for theme-specific image generation.",

    "abstract":"Context. The localized formation of planetesimals can be triggered with the\nhelp of streaming instability when the local pebble density is high. This can\nhappen at various locations in the disk leading to the formation of local\nplanetesimal rings. The planetesimals in these rings subsequently grow from\nmutual collisions and by pebble accretion. Aims. We investigate the early\ngrowth of protoplanetary embryos from a ring of planetesimals created from\nstreaming instability to see if they reach sizes where they accrete pebbles\nefficiently. Methods. We simulate the early stages of planet formation for\nrings of planetesimals that we assume were created by streaming instability at\nvarious separations from the star and for various stellar masses using a\nsemi-analytic model. Results. The rings in the inner disk are able to produce\nprotoplanetary embryos in a short time whereas at large separations there is\nlittle to no growth. The growth of the largest bodies is significantly slower\naround lower-mass stars. Conclusions. The formation of planetary embryos from\nfilaments during the disk lifetime is possible but strongly dependent on the\nseparation from the star and the mass of the host star. It remains difficult to\nform the seeds of pebble accretion early in the outer disk \\sim 50AU,\nespecially for low-mass stars.",

    "abstract":"We uncovered a more tilted molecular gas structure with highly negative\nvelocities located near the dust lane. Our observations also show that the\napproaching gas flows from the overshoot process are captured by the bar\ngravitational and then flows towards the Galactic Central Molecular Zone (CMZ)\nthrough the bar channel. The recycling gas from the overshoot effect, in\nconjunction with freshly accreted gas from the inner 3-kpc disk, accumulates\nsignificantly near R_GC~1\/2R_bar and R_GC~2\/3R_bar regions by adopting a bar\nlength of ~3.2--3.4kpc. Importantly, within these regions, there are frequent\ncollisions and substantial angular momentum exchanges between gas flows with\ndifferent trajectories. In this scenario, the DISSIPATION processes arising\nfrom interactions between colliding flows, together with the varying torques\ninduced by the non-axisymmetric bar, effectively transfer the angular momentum\nof viscous gas outward, thereby driving the molecular gas to settle into the\nCMZ within ~3 orbital periods. A long-term gas inflow with an average rate of\n>1.1Msun\/yr, coupled with intense transient accretion events that exceed the\naverage rate by several times due to the overshoot effect, significantly\nregulates the gas distribution, physical properties, and dynamical evolution of\nthe CMZ. These findings provide robust observational evidence for elucidating\nthe intricate dynamics of molecular gas flows towards the CMZ. Our results show\nthat gas dynamics has a significant impact on the secular evolution of both the\nMilky Way and the extragalactic gas-rich galaxies.",

We compute the bulk-to-bulk, bulk-to boundary and\nboundary-to-boundary propagators for massless scalar theory. Due to the\ndoubling of the fields degrees of freedom, the number of each propagator is\nquadrupled. The bulk-to-boundary propagators have the form of (extended)\nBose-Einstein distribution in the position space. Utilizing the contour\nintegral of the propagators, we can transform the Feynman rules to momentum\nspace. Interestingly, the external lines and the amplitude in the momentum\nspace depend on the contour while Carrollian correlators in the position space\nare independent of the contour. We show how to compute four point correlators\nat finite temperature. The tree level correlators can be written as the\nsummation of Barnes zeta functions and reduce to the ones in the zero\ntemperature limit.",

    "abstract":"Frequency-diverse array (FDA) is an alternative array architecture in which\neach antenna is preceded by a mixer instead of a phase shifter. The mixers\nintroduce a frequency offset between signals transmitted by each antenna\nresulting in a time-varying beam pattern. However, time-dependent beamforming\nis not desirable for communication or sensing. In this paper, the FDA is\ncombined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The\nproposed beamforming method splits the OFDM symbol transmitted by all antennas\ninto subcarrier blocks, which are precoded differently. The selected frequency\noffset between the antennas results in overlap and coherent summation of the\ndifferently precoded subcarrier blocks. This allows to achieve fully digital\nbeamforming over a single block with the use of a single digital-to-analog\nconverter. The system's joint communication and sensing performance is\nevaluated and sensitivity to errors is studied.",

In recent years, kagome\nmetals have emerged as an excellent platform for investigating these unique\nproperties, which stem from their itinerant carriers arranged in a kagome\nlattice. Here, we show that electronic structure of the prototypical kagome\nmetal, Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, can be tailored by manipulating the breathing distortion\nof its kagome lattice with external pressure. The breathing distortion is\nsuppressed around 15 GPa and reversed at higher pressures. These changes lead\nto a series of Lifshitz transitions that we detect using broadband and\ntransient optical spectroscopy. Remarkably, the strength of the electronic\ncorrelations and the tendency to carrier localization are enhanced as the\nkagome network becomes more regular, suggesting that breathing distortion can\nbe a unique control parameter for the microscopic regime of the kagome metals\nand their electron dynamics.",

To\naddress these issues, we propose PedDet, an adaptive spectral optimization\ncomplementarity framework specifically enhanced and optimized for multispectral\npedestrian detection. PedDet introduces the Multi-scale Spectral Feature\nPerception Module (MSFPM) to adaptively fuse visible and infrared features,\nenhancing robustness and flexibility in feature extraction. Additionally, the\nIllumination Robustness Feature Decoupling Module (IRFDM) improves detection\nstability under varying lighting by decoupling pedestrian and background\nfeatures. We further design a contrastive alignment to enhance intermodal\nfeature discrimination. Experiments on LLVIP and MSDS datasets demonstrate that\nPedDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the mAP by 6.6% with\nsuperior detection accuracy even in low-light conditions, marking a significant\nstep forward for road safety.

    "abstract":"Understanding the phase stability of elemental lithium (Li) is crucial for\noptimizing its performance in lithium-metal battery anodes, yet this seemingly\nsimple metal exhibits complex polymorphism that requires proper accounting for\nquantum and anharmonic effects to capture the subtleties in its flat energy\nlandscape. Here we address this challenge by developing an accurate graph\nneural network-based machine learning force field and performing efficient\nself-consistent phonon calculations for bcc-, fcc-, and 9R-Li under\nnear-ambient conditions, incorporating quantum, phonon renormalization and\nthermal expansion effects. Our results reveal the important role of\nanharmonicity in determining Li's thermodynamic properties. The free energy\ndifferences between these phases, particularly fcc- and 9R-Li are found to be\nonly a few meV\/atom, explaining the experimental challenges in obtaining\nphase-pure samples and suggesting a propensity for stacking faults and related\ndefect formation. fcc-Li is confirmed as the ground state at zero temperature\nand pressure, and the predicted bcc-fcc phase boundary qualitatively matches\nexperimental phase transition lines, despite overestimation of the transition\ntemperature and pressure slope. These findings provide crucial insights into\nLi's complex polymorphism and establish an effective computational approach for\nlarge-scale atomistic simulations of Li in more realistic settings for\npractical energy storage applications.",

    "abstract":"Replication protocols are essential for distributed systems, ensuring\nconsistency, reliability, and fault tolerance. Traditional Crash Fault Tolerant\n(CFT) protocols, which assume a fail-stop model, are inadequate for untrusted\ncloud environments where adversaries or software bugs can cause Byzantine\nbehavior. Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols address these threats but\nface significant performance, resource overheads, and scalability challenges.\nThis paper introduces Recipe, a novel approach to transforming CFT protocols to\noperate securely in Byzantine settings without altering their core logic.\nRecipe rethinks CFT protocols in the context of modern cloud hardware,\nincluding many-core servers, RDMA-capable networks, and Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEEs). The approach leverages these advancements to enhance the\nsecurity and performance of replication protocols in untrusted cloud\nenvironments. Recipe implements two practical security mechanisms, i.e.,\ntransferable authentication and non-equivocation, using TEEs and\nhigh-performance networking stacks (e.g., RDMA, DPDK). These mechanisms ensure\nthat any CFT protocol can be transformed into a BFT protocol, guaranteeing\nauthenticity and non-equivocation. The Recipe protocol consists of five key\ncomponents: transferable authentication, initialization, normal operation, view\nchange, and recovery phases. The protocol's correctness is formally verified\nusing Tamarin, a symbolic model checker. Recipe is implemented as a library and\napplied to transform four widely used CFT protocols-Raft, Chain Replication,\nABD, and AllConcur-into Byzantine settings. The results demonstrate up to 24x\nhigher throughput compared to PBFT and 5.9x better performance than\nstate-of-the-art BFT protocols. Additionally, Recipe requires fewer replicas\nand offers confidentiality, a feature absent in traditional BFT protocols.",

    "abstract":"Decision making often uses complex computer codes run at the exa-scale (10e18\nflops). Such computer codes or models are often run in a hierarchy of different\nlevels of fidelity ranging from the basic to the very sophisticated. The top\nlevels in this hierarchy are expensive to run, limiting the number of possible\nruns. To make use of runs over all levels, and crucially improve emulation at\nthe top level, we use multi-level Gaussian process emulators (GPs). We will\npresent a new method of building GP emulators from hierarchies of models. In\norder to share information across the different levels, l=1,...,L, we define\nthe form of the prior of the l+1th level to be the posterior of the lth level,\nhence building a Bayesian hierarchical structure for the top Lth level. This\nenables us to not only learn about the GP hyperparameters as we move up the\nmulti-level hierarchy, but also allows us to limit the total number of\nparameters in the full model, whilst maintaining accuracy.",

    "abstract":"Terrorist activities often exhibit temporal and spatial clustering, making\nthe multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) a useful statistical model for analysing\nterrorism across different geographic regions. However, terror attack data from\nthe Global Terrorism Database is reported as total event counts in disjoint\nobservation periods, with precise event times unknown. When the MHP is only\nobserved discretely, the likelihood function becomes intractable, hindering\nlikelihood-based inference. To address this, we design an unbiased estimate of\nthe intractable likelihood function using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based on\na representation of the unobserved event times as latent variables in a\nstate-space model. The unbiasedness of the SMC estimate allows for its use in\nplace of the true likelihood in a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, from which we\nconstruct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sample of the distribution over the\nparameters of the MHP. Using simulated data, we assess the performance of our\nmethod and demonstrate that it outperforms an alternative method in the\nliterature based on mean squared error.

    "abstract":"When formulating a model there is a trade-off between model complexity and\n(biological) realism. In the present paper we demonstrate how model reduction\nfrom a precise mechanistic \"super model\" to simpler conceptual models using\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions, an algebraic approach to singular perturbation\ntheory, can mitigate this problem. Compared to traditional methods for time\nscale separations (Tikhonov's theorem, quasi-steady state assumption),\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions have the advantage that we can compute a reduction\ndirectly for a separation of rates into slow and fast ones instead of a\nseparation of components of the system. Moreover, we can find all such\nreductions algorithmically.\n  In the present paper we use Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions to analyse a\nmutualism model tailored towards lichens with an explicit description of the\ninteraction. We find that (1) the implicit description of the interaction given\nin the reductions by interaction terms (functional responses) varies depending\non the scenario, (2) there is a tendency for the mycobiont, an obligate\nmutualist, to always benefit from the interaction while it can be detrimental\nfor the photobiont, a facultative mutualist, depending on the parameters, (3)\nour model is capable of describing the shift from mutualism to parasitism, (4)\nour model can produce bistability with multiple stable fixed points in the\ninterior of the first orthant. To analyse the reductions we formalize and\ndiscuss a mathematical criterion that categorizes two-species interactions.\nThroughout the paper we focus on the relation between the mathematics behind\nTikhonov-Fenichel reductions and their biological interpretation.",

    "abstract":"Detecting potential optimal peak areas and locating the accurate peaks in\nthese areas are two major challenges in Multimodal Optimization problems\n(MMOPs). To address them, much efforts have been spent on developing novel\nsearching operators, niching strategies and multi-objective problem\ntransformation pipelines. Though promising, existing approaches more or less\noverlook the potential usage of landscape knowledge. In this paper, we propose\na novel optimization framework tailored for MMOPs, termed as APDMMO, which\nfacilitates peak detection via fully leveraging the landscape knowledge and\nhence capable of providing strong optimization performance on MMOPs.\nSpecifically, we first design a novel surrogate landscape model which ensembles\na group of non-linear activation units to improve the regression accuracy on\ndiverse MMOPs. Then we propose a free-of-trial peak detection method which\nefficiently locates potential peak areas through back-propagation on the\nlearned surrogate landscape model. Based on the detected peak areas, we employ\nSEP-CMAES for local search within these areas in parallel to further improve\nthe accuracy of the found optima. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate\nthat APDMMO outperforms several up-to-date baselines. Further ablation studies\nverify the effectiveness of the proposed novel designs.

Moreover, the continua are not\nwell-described by physically plausible irradiated disc models. All of this\nchallenges the standard reprocessing picture for UV emission from erupting\nLMXBs. The UV emission lines are double-peaked, with high-ionization lines\ndisplaying higher peak-to-peak velocities. None of the lines display obvious\noutflow signatures, even though blue-shifted absorption features have been seen\nin optical and near-infrared lines during the hard state. The emission line\nratios are consistent with normal abundances, suggesting that the donor mass at\nbirth was low enough to avoid CNO processing ($\\rm M_{2,i} \\lesssim 1.0 - 1.5\n{\\mathrm M_{\\odot}}$). Finally, we study the evolution of UV variability in our\ntime-resolved HST observations (hard and hard-intermediate states). All UV\npower spectra can be modelled with a broken power-law, superposed on which we\ntentatively detect the $\\simeq 18$s quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) that has\nbeen seen in other spectral bands.",

    "abstract":"Achieving scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation requires quantum\nmemory architectures that minimize error correction overhead while preserving\ncoherence. This work presents a framework for high-dimensional qudit memory in\n153Eu:Y2SiO5, integrating three core mechanisms: (i) non-destructive syndrome\nextraction, using spin-echo sequences to encode error syndromes without direct\nmeasurement; (ii) adaptive quantum Fourier transform (QFT) for error\nidentification, leveraging frequency-space transformations to reduce gate\ncomplexity; and (iii) coset-based fault-tolerant correction, factorizing large\nstabilizer-like unitaries into modular operations to confine error propagation.\nBy combining generalized stabilizer formalism, Weyl-Heisenberg operators, and\nfinite-group coset decompositions, we develop a qudit error correction scheme\noptimized for solid-state quantum memory. This approach circumvents\nresource-intensive multi-qubit concatenation, enabling scalable, long-lived\nquantum storage with efficient state retrieval and computational redundancy.\nThese results provide a pathway toward practical fault-tolerant architectures\nfor rare-earth-ion-doped quantum memories.",

    "abstract":"Perceptive mobile networks (PMNs), integrating ubiquitous sensing\ncapabilities into mobile networks, represent an important application of\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. In this paper, we propose a\npractical framework for uplink sensing of angle-of-arrival (AoA), Doppler, and\ndelay in millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, which addresses\nchallenges posed by clock asynchrony and hybrid arrays, while being compatible\nwith existing communication protocols. We first introduce a beam scanning\nmethod and a corresponding AoA estimation algorithm, which utilizes frequency\nsmoothing to effectively estimate AoAs for both static and dynamic paths. We\nthen propose several methods for constructing a ``clean'' reference signal,\nwhich is subsequently used to cancel the effect caused by the clock asynchrony.\nWe further develop a signal ratio-based joint AoA-Doppler-delay estimator and\npropose an AoA-based 2D-FFT-MUSIC (AB2FM) algorithm that applies 2D-FFT\noperations on the signal subspace, which accelerates the computation process\nwith low complexity. Our proposed framework can estimate parameters in pairs,\nremoving the complicated parameter association process. Simulation results\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and demonstrate its\nrobustness in both low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.",

    "abstract":"Learned optimization has emerged as a promising alternative to hand-crafted\noptimizers, with the potential to discover stronger learned update rules that\nenable faster, hyperparameter-free training of neural networks. A critical\nelement for practically useful learned optimizers, that can be used\noff-the-shelf after meta-training, is strong meta-generalization: the ability\nto apply the optimizers to new tasks. Recent state-of-the-art work in learned\noptimizers, VeLO (Metz et al., 2022), requires a large number of highly diverse\nmeta-training tasks along with massive computational resources, 4000 TPU\nmonths, to achieve meta-generalization. This makes further improvements to such\nlearned optimizers impractical. In this work, we identify several key elements\nin learned optimizer architectures and meta-training procedures that can lead\nto strong meta-generalization. We also propose evaluation metrics to reliably\nassess quantitative performance of an optimizer at scale on a set of evaluation\ntasks. Our proposed approach, Celo, makes a significant leap in improving the\nmeta-generalization performance of learned optimizers and also outperforms\ntuned state-of-the-art optimizers on a diverse set of out-of-distribution\ntasks, despite being meta-trained for just 24 GPU hours.",

    "abstract":"1. An understanding of how biodiversity confers ecosystem stability is\ncrucial in managing ecosystems under major environmental changes. Multiple\nbiodiversity drivers can stabilize ecosystem functions over time. However, we\nknow little about how local environmental conditions can influence these\nbiodiversity drivers, and consequently how they indirectly shape the ecological\nstability of ecosystems.\n  2. We hypothesized that environmental factors can have opposite influences\n(i.e., not necessarily either positive or negative) on the temporal stability\nof communities in different environmental ranges depending on the biodiversity\ndrivers involved. We tested this novel hypothesis by using data from a\n4-year-long field study of submerged macrophyte across a water depth gradient\nin 8 heterogeneous bays of Erhai lake (with total sample size of 30,071\nquadrats), a large lentic system in China.\n  3. Results indicate that a unimodal pattern of stability in temporal biomass\nmeasurements occurred along the water-depth gradient, and that multiple\nbiodiversity drivers (the asynchrony in species dynamics, and the stability of\ndominant species) generally increased the temporal stability of aquatic primary\nproducers. However, the effect of water depth either increased or decreased the\nstability of biomass according to the environmental conditions associated with\nsites along the water depth gradient.\n  4.

    "abstract":"Unsupervised learning of disentangled representations has been closely tied\nto enhancing the representation intepretability of Recommender Systems (RSs).\nThis has been achieved by making the representation of individual features more\ndistinctly separated, so that it is easier to attribute the contribution of\nfeatures to the model's predictions. However, such advantages in\ninterpretability and feature attribution have mainly been explored\nqualitatively. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on the model's\nrecommendation performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, we\nreproduce the recommendation performance, representation disentanglement and\nrepresentation interpretability of five well-known recommendation models on\nfour RS datasets. We quantify disentanglement and investigate the link of\ndisentanglement with recommendation effectiveness and representation\ninterpretability. While several existing work in RSs have proposed disentangled\nrepresentations as a gateway to improved effectiveness and interpretability,\nour findings show that disentanglement is not necessarily related to\neffectiveness but is closely related to representation interpretability.

    "title":"B3C: A Minimalist Approach to Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract":"Overestimation arising from selecting unseen actions during policy evaluation\nis a major challenge in offline reinforcement learning (RL). A minimalist\napproach in the single-agent setting -- adding behavior cloning (BC)\nregularization to existing online RL algorithms -- has been shown to be\neffective; however, this approach is understudied in multi-agent settings. In\nparticular, overestimation becomes worse in multi-agent settings due to the\npresence of multiple actions, resulting in the BC regularization-based approach\neasily suffering from either over-regularization or critic divergence. To\naddress this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Behavior Cloning\nregularization with Critic Clipping (B3C), which clips the target critic value\nin policy evaluation based on the maximum return in the dataset and pushes the\nlimit of the weight on the RL objective over BC regularization, thereby\nimproving performance. Additionally, we leverage existing value factorization\ntechniques, particularly non-linear factorization, which is understudied in\noffline settings. Integrated with non-linear value factorization, B3C\noutperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on various offline multi-agent\nbenchmarks.",

    "title":"Punctuation patterns in \"Finnegans Wake\" by James Joyce are largely\n  translation-invariant",
    "abstract":"The complexity characteristics of texts written in natural languages are\nsignificantly related to the rules of punctuation. In particular, the distances\nbetween punctuation marks measured by the number of words quite universally\nfollow the family of Weibull distributions known from survival analyses.\nHowever, the values of two parameters marking specific forms of these\ndistributions distinguish specific languages. This is such a strong constraint\nthat the punctuation distributions of texts translated from the original\nlanguage into another adopt quantitative characteristics of the target\nlanguage. All these changes take place within Weibull distributions such that\nthe corresponding hazard functions are always increasing. Recent previous\nresearch shows that James Joyce's famous \"Finnegans Wake\" is subject to such\nextreme distribution from the Weibull family that the corresponding hazard\nfunction is clearly decreasing. At the same time, the distances of sentence\nending punctuation marks, determining the variability of sentence length, have\nan almost perfect multifractal organization, so far to such an extent found\nnowhere else in the literature. In the present contribution based on several\navailable translations (Dutch, French, German, Polish, Russian) of \"Finnegans\nWake\", it is shown that the punctuation characteristics of this work remain\nlargely translation invariant, contrary to the common cases. These observations\nmay constitute further evidence that \"Finnegans Wake\" is a translinguistic work\nin this respect as well, in line with Joyce's original intention.",

    "abstract":"As a direct consequence of liquid kerosene injection, aeroengine combustors\nmay be categorized as non-premixed combustion systems, characterized by a\nswirl-stabilized and highly complex flow field. In addition to the flow of air\nthrough the fuel injector, there are a large number of other features through\nwhich oxidizer can enter the heat release region. These can have an impact on\nlocal fuel-air mixing, inducing strong spatial and temporal variations in\nstoichiometry, thereby affecting emissions and combustion system performance.\nThis paper discusses a novel statistical methodology, based on Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering, that aims to improve\nunderstanding of fuel-air mixing in realistic aeroengine combustors. The method\nis applied in a postprocessing step to data sampled from a Large Eddy\nSimulation (LES), where every chamber inflow has been tagged with a unique\npassive scalar, which allows it to be traced across space and time. PCA is used\nto construct a low-dimensional, visually interpretable representation of a\nspatially localized fuel-air mixing process, while K-means clustering is\nemployed to produce an unsupervised discretization of the flow field into\nregions of similar fuel-air mixing characteristics. The proposed methodology is\ncomputationally inexpensive, and the easily interpretable outputs can help the\ncombustion engineer make better informed decisions about combustor design.",

    "abstract":"This paper studies the uplink and downlink power allocation for interactive\naugmented reality (AR) services, where live video captured by an AR device is\nuploaded to the network edge and then the augmented video is subsequently\ndownloaded. By modeling the AR transmission process as a tandem queuing system,\nwe derive an upper bound for the probabilistic quality of service (QoS)\nrequirement concerning end-to-end latency and reliability. The resource\nallocation with the QoS constraints results in a functional optimization\nproblem. To address it, we design a deep neural network to learn the power\nallocation policy, leveraging the structure of optimal power allocation to\nenhance learning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod effectively reduces transmit powers while meeting the QoS requirement.",

    "abstract":"Metal-stuffed B-C compounds with sodalite clathrate structure have captured\nincreasing attention due to their predicted exceptional superconductivity above\nliquid nitrogen temperature at ambient pressure. However, by neglecting the\nquantum lattice anharmonicity, the existing studies may result in an incomplete\nunderstanding of such a lightweight system. Here, using state-of-the-art *ab\ninitio* methods incorporating quantum effects and machine learning potentials,\nwe revisit the properties of a series of $XY\\text{B}_{6}\\text{C}_{6}$\nclathrates where $X$ and $Y$ are metals. Our findings show that ionic quantum\nand anharmonic effects can harden the $E_g$ and $E_u$ vibrational modes,\nenabling the dynamical stability of 15 materials previously considered unstable\nin the harmonic approximation, including materials with previously unreported\n$(XY)^{1+}$ state, which is demonstrated here to be crucial to reach high\ncritical temperatures.

However, images provided in bug reports have been overlooked.\nTo address this gap, this paper presents an empirical study investigating the\nnecessity of including images as part of the input in automated bug\nreproduction. We examined the characteristics and patterns of images in bug\nreports, focusing on (1) the distribution and types of images (e.g., UI\nscreenshots), (2) documentation patterns associated with images (e.g.,\naccompanying text, annotations), and (3) the functional roles they served,\nparticularly their contribution to reproducing bugs. Furthermore, we analyzed\nthe impact of images on the performance of existing tools, identifying the\nreasons behind their influence and the ways in which they can be leveraged to\nimprove bug reproduction. Our findings reveal several key insights that\ndemonstrate the importance of images in supporting automated bug reproduction.\nSpecifically, we identified six distinct functional roles that images serve in\nbug reports, each exhibiting unique patterns and specific contributions to the\nbug reproduction process.

We suppose that one of the functions is proper, closed, and\nconvex but non-necessarily smooth whilst the second is a smooth enough function\nbut not necessarily convex. For the latter, we ask the smooth adaptable\nproperty (smad) with respect to some kernel or entropy which allows to remove\nthe very popular global Lipschitz continuity requirement on the gradient of the\nsmooth part. We consider the IBPG under the framework of the triangle scaling\nproperty (TSP) which is a geometrical property for which one can provably\nensure acceleration for a certain subset of kernel\/entropy functions in the\nconvex setting. Based on this property, we provide global convergence\nguarantees when the entropy is strongly convex under the framework of the\nKurdyka-\\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) property. Turning to the local convergence\nproperties, we show that when the nonsmooth part is partly smooth relative to a\nsmooth submanifold, IBPG has a finite activity identification property before\nentering a local linear convergence regime for which we establish a sharp\nestimate of the convergence rate.

    "abstract":"The major goal of quantum metrology (QM) is to exploit the quantum resources\nto raise the measurement precision (MP) as high as possible. When the quantum\nresources such as squeezing has been widely explored, light-mater interaction\nsystems set up a highly controllable platform applicable for QM in novel\npursuit of high MP. However, critical QM by the conventional linear interaction\nis confronted with the restriction of low-frequency-limit condition and the\ndetrimental problem of diverging preparation time of the probe state (PTPS).\nThis work shows that mixed interactions by linear and nonlinear light-matter\ncouplings in the presence of bias field can provide various quantum resources,\nincluding squeezing, degeneracy lifting, displacement and quantum phase\ntransition. These resources manifest high sensitivity for QM as demonstrated by\nanalytically obtained critical components or exponential behavior of quantum\nFisher information. We find that these sensitivity resources can be combined to\nupgrade the upper bound of MP by many orders over the widely-applied squeezing\nresource. As further advantages, such an upgraded metrology protocol not only\nbreaks the frequency-limit restrictions but also avoids the detrimental problem\nof diverging PTPS which were both encountered in linear interaction. Our work\npaves a way to exploit and combine all the resources in momentum, position and\nspin spaces to maximize the MP and expand the applicable conditions\nsimultaneously.",

    "abstract":"Context-aware compression techniques have gained increasing attention as\nmodel sizes continue to grow, introducing computational bottlenecks that hinder\nefficient deployment. A structured encoding approach was proposed to\nselectively eliminate redundant parameter groups while ensuring that\nrepresentational fidelity was preserved across multiple layers. Contextual\nCompression Encoding (CCE) introduced a multi-stage encoding mechanism that\ndynamically restructured parameter distributions, allowing for significant\nreductions in memory footprint and computational complexity. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrated that models compressed through CCE retained linguistic\nexpressivity and coherence, maintaining accuracy across a range of text\ngeneration and classification tasks. Layer-wise analysis revealed that\nmiddle-network layers exhibited higher compression ratios, aligning with the\nobservation that self-attention and feed-forward transformations contained\nredundancies that could be reorganized without impairing functional capacity.\nComparisons against conventional quantization and pruning methods confirmed\nthat CCE provided a more balanced trade-off between efficiency and model\nretention, achieving reductions in energy consumption and inference latency\nwithout requiring extensive retraining. Computational efficiency improvements\nwere particularly evident in deployment scenarios involving\nresource-constrained environments, where reductions in memory usage enabled\nmore scalable implementations. Further analyses of internal network behavior\nshowed that compressed models exhibited stable activation distributions and\nadapted dynamically to input variations, reinforcing the viability of\nstructured compression strategies for optimizing large-scale architectures.",

    "title":"Taxonomy of amorphous ternary phase diagrams: the importance of\n  interaction parameters",
    "abstract":"Understanding phase diagrams is essential for material selection and design,\nas they provide a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of\nmixtures. This work delivers a broad and systematic overview of possible\nternary phase diagrams for amorphous systems representative of polymers, small\norganic molecules, and solvents. Thanks to computationally efficient methods,\nan unprecedented library of $>$80,000 ternary phase diagrams is generated based\non a systematic screening of interaction parameters. Twenty-one phase diagram\ntypes, including unreported ones, are identified. They are classified according\nto simple rules related to the number of immiscible material pairs, of\nmiscibility gaps, and of three-phase regions. They are mapped onto the\nthree-dimensional interaction parameters space, providing a clear picture of\ntheir likelihood and existence conditions. Four well-known phase-diagram types\nwith 0, 1, 2, or 3 immiscible pairs are found to be the most likely. The\nnumerous uncommon phase diagrams are mostly observed within a small parameter\nwindow around the critical interaction parameter values. For the most common\nphase diagram types, we show that the size of the processability window becomes\nsensitive to interaction parameter variations close to critical values. The\nsensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally,\nsuccessful comparisons of simulated and experimental phase diagrams showcase\nthe real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis. The presented results\nlay a robust foundation for rational design of solution processing conditions\nand for blend morphology control. Immediate applications include organic thin\nfilms and the identification of green solvents for sustainable processing.",

    "abstract":"Recent advances in the field of structured waves have resulted in\nsophisticated coherent wavefront shaping schemes that provide unprecedented\ncontrol of waves in various complex settings. These techniques exploit multiple\nscattering events and the resulting interference of wave paths within these\ncomplex environments. Here, we introduce the concept of targeted mode transport\n(TMT), which enables energy transfer from specific input channels to designated\noutput channels in multimode wave-chaotic cavities by effectively engaging\nnumerous cavity modes. We develop a statistical theory that provides upper\nbounds on optimal TMT, incorporating operational realities such as losses,\ncoupling strengths and the accessibility of specific interrogating channels.\nThe theoretical predictions for the probability distribution of TMT eigenvalues\nare validated through experiments with microwave chaotic networks of coaxial\ncables as well as two-dimensional and three-dimensional complex cavities. These\nfindings have broad implications for applications ranging from indoor wireless\ncommunications to imaging and beyond.",

    "abstract":"In the context of the Swampland program, black hole attractors have been\nemployed to probe infinite distances in moduli space, where the EFT cutoff goes\nto zero in Planck units and UV effects become significant. In this paper, we\ntake the perspective of the two-derivative action of string theoretic effective\nfield theories and explore various families of extremal black hole solutions\nthat probe infinite distance limits at their horizons. While these solutions do\nnot include higher-order corrections in the EFT expansion, we find that, in\nmany cases, the smallest BPS black holes in these families remarkably reproduce\neither the species scale or some other Kaluza-Klein scale. In highly\nsupersymmetric cases, this match with UV scales even persists in the interior\nof moduli space. We even find that non-BPS black holes solutions in circle\ncompactification of Type II string theories follow the species scale in\ndecompactification limits. These observations suggests that the two-derivative\naction may encode information about relevant UV scales. We discuss the\ninterplay of these results with emergence and UV\/IR mixing in quantum gravity.",

In this\nwork, we examine the new physics effects of light mediators through elastic\nneutrino-electron scattering using solar neutrinos at the low energy range of\nPandaX-4T. These mediators, with a mass less than $1$ GeV, are common\nproperties of extensions to the SM. Accordingly, we consider universal light\nmediator models involving scalar, vector, and tensor interactions allowed by\nLorentz invariance, and the anomaly-free $U(1)'$ extensions of the SM with a\nnew vector mediator such as the $L_e-L_\\mu$, $L_e-L_\\tau$ and $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$\ngauge models in which the charges are exclusively leptonic. The new physics\neffects are analyzed by embedding each model into the SM process using solar\nneutrino flux. We obtain novel constraints on the coupling-mass plane of these\nmodels from the latest Run0 and Run1 datasets of the PandaX-4T experiment. We\nalso compare our results with other limits derived from various terrestrial and\nastrophysical experiments.

    "title":"Hide and seek with a Neutron Star. Hint of Neutron Star activity in SN\n  2015ap light curve",
    "abstract":"Aims. We present a detailed study of the unique SN 2015ap, a very energetic\nevent, notable for its exceptionally high bolometric peak magnitude if compared\nto other well-know Type Ib supernovae. We analyzed its multi-wavelength light\ncurve, which exhibited a possible period modulation that could result from a\ngeometrical effect. Methods. We analyzed the modulation present at all\navailable bands in SN 2015ap's light curves using a Bayesian approach for\nmeasuring the period of variability. Additionally, narrow Ha emission is\nobserved in late-time spectra, exhibiting periodic velocity shifts likely\noriginating from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the\ncompact remnant. Results. We propose that SN 2015ap's significant light curve\nmodulation arise from accretion onto a neutron star as the remnant of SN\n2015ap. Our multi-wavelength observations reveal a sinusoidal modulation with a\nperiod of 8.4 days, confirmed by periodic variations in the Ha emission lines.\nTraditional models of circumstellar medium interactions cannot account for\nthese features due to the unusually high ejection rates required. Using the\nTaylor-Spruit dynamo model, we suggest that the interaction between accreting\nmatter and the neutron star's magnetosphere could account for the observed\nperiodic modulation. This implies assuming an ejecta-companion interaction\nbecause the accretion from fallback ejecta alone would not produce the observed\nmodulation. The binary configuration, characterized by a separation of less\nthan 50 Ro, supports a magnetized neutron star central engine as the primary\nmechanism, rather than models involving circumstellar material interaction.",

Here, we observe, for the first time, that it is not only\nmonolithic, spherical particles, but also real dust aggregates, that become\ntribocharged and end up forming large clusters. For aggregates of $\\sim 0.4$ mm\nconsisting of $\\rm \\sim$ 1 $\\rm \\mu m$ sized dust, we determined net charge\ndensities up to $10^{-7}$ C\/$\\rm m^2$ during our drop tower experiments. These\ncharged aggregates form compact clusters up to 2 cm in size via collisions with\nother clusters and aggregates at collision velocities on the order of 1 cm\/s.\nSize and speed are the only lower limits for growth, currently set by the\nlimits of the experiment. However, these clusters already form under conditions\nthat are well beyond the expected transition to bouncing for uncharged\naggregates and clusters. Our findings further support the idea that collisional\ncharging can leapfrog the traditional bouncing barrier and form larger clusters\nthat then serve as large pebbles. These cm-sized clusters are more susceptible\nto further evolutionary steps via particle trapping, concentration, and\nplanetesimal formation.",

    "abstract":"Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) identifies anomalies without needing\ntraining samples from the target dataset, essential for scenarios with privacy\nconcerns or limited data. Vision-language models like CLIP show potential in\nZSAD but have limitations: relying on manually crafted fixed textual\ndescriptions or anomaly prompts is time-consuming and prone to semantic\nambiguity, and CLIP struggles with pixel-level anomaly segmentation, focusing\nmore on global semantics than local details. To address these limitations, We\nintroduce KAnoCLIP, a novel ZSAD framework that leverages vision-language\nmodels. KAnoCLIP combines general knowledge from a Large Language Model\n(GPT-3.5) and fine-grained, image-specific knowledge from a Visual Question\nAnswering system (Llama3) via Knowledge-Driven Prompt Learning (KnPL). KnPL\nuses a knowledge-driven (KD) loss function to create learnable anomaly prompts,\nremoving the need for fixed text prompts and enhancing generalization. KAnoCLIP\nincludes the CLIP visual encoder with V-V attention (CLIP-VV), Bi-Directional\nCross-Attention for Multi-Level Cross-Modal Interaction (Bi-CMCI), and\nConv-Adapter. These components preserve local visual semantics, improve local\ncross-modal fusion, and align global visual features with textual information,\nenhancing pixel-level anomaly detection. KAnoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in ZSAD across 12 industrial and medical datasets, demonstrating\nsuperior generalization compared to existing methods.",

However, the role\nof 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored.\nFurthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are\ntypically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen\nencoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the\npossibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from\nuni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces.

Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared\nsubspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data\nrepresentations.

    "title":"Graph-Augmented Reasoning: Evolving Step-by-Step Knowledge Graph\n  Retrieval for LLM Reasoning",
    "abstract":"Recent large language model (LLM) reasoning, despite its success, suffers\nfrom limited domain knowledge, susceptibility to hallucinations, and\nconstrained reasoning depth, particularly in small-scale models deployed in\nresource-constrained environments. This paper presents the first investigation\ninto integrating step-wise knowledge graph retrieval with step-wise reasoning\nto address these challenges, introducing a novel paradigm termed as\ngraph-augmented reasoning. Our goal is to enable frozen, small-scale LLMs to\nretrieve and process relevant mathematical knowledge in a step-wise manner,\nenhancing their problem-solving abilities without additional training. To this\nend, we propose KG-RAR, a framework centered on process-oriented knowledge\ngraph construction, a hierarchical retrieval strategy, and a universal\npost-retrieval processing and reward model (PRP-RM) that refines retrieved\ninformation and evaluates each reasoning step. Experiments on the Math500 and\nGSM8K benchmarks across six models demonstrate that KG-RAR yields encouraging\nresults, achieving a 20.73\\% relative improvement with Llama-3B on Math500.",

    "abstract":"Context: Developing compilers and static analysis tools (\"language tools\") is\na difficult and time-consuming task. We have previously presented *property\nprobes*, a technique to help the language tool developer build understanding of\ntheir tool. A probe presents a live view into the internals of the compiler,\nenabling the developer to see all the intermediate steps of a compilation or\nanalysis rather than just the final output. This technique has been realized in\na tool called CodeProber.\n  Inquiry: CodeProber has been in active use in both research and education for\nover two years, but its practical use has not been well studied. CodeProber\ncombines liveness, AST exploration and presenting program analysis results on\ntop of source code. While there are other tools that specifically target\nlanguage tool developers, we are not aware of any that has the same design as\nCodeProber, much less any such tool with an extensive user study. We therefore\nclaim there is a lack of knowledge how property probes (and by extension\nCodeProber) are used in practice.\n  Approach: We present the results from a mixed-method study of use of\nCodeProber in an educational setting, with the goal to discover if and how\nproperty probes help, and how they compare to more traditional techniques such\nas test cases and print debugging. In the study, we analyzed data from 11\nin-person interviews with students using CodeProber as part of a course on\nprogram analysis. We also analyzed CodeProber event logs from 24 students in\nthe same course, and 51 anonymized survey responses across two courses where\nCodeProber was used.\n  Knowledge: Our findings show that the students find CodeProber to be useful,\nand they make continuous use of it during the course labs. We further find that\nthe students in our study seem to partially or fully use CodeProber instead of\nother development tools and techniques, e.g. breakpoint\/step-debugging, test\ncases and print debugging.\n  Grounding: Our claims are supported by three different data sources: 11\nin-person interviews, log analysis from 24 students, and surveys with 51\nresponses.\n  Importance: We hope our findings inspire others to consider live exploration\nto help language tool developers build understanding of their tool.",

To this end, this paper\nintroduces GeoAggregator, an efficient and lightweight algorithm based on\ntransformer architecture designed specifically for geospatial tabular data\nmodeling. GeoAggregators explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation and\nspatial heterogeneity through Gaussian-biased local attention and global\npositional awareness. Additionally, we introduce a new attention mechanism that\nuses the Cartesian product to manage the size of the model while maintaining\nstrong expressive power. We benchmark GeoAggregator against spatial statistical\nmodels, XGBoost, and several state-of-the-art geospatial deep learning methods\nusing both synthetic and empirical geospatial datasets. The results demonstrate\nthat GeoAggregators achieve the best or second-best performance compared to\ntheir competitors on nearly all datasets. GeoAggregator's efficiency is\nunderscored by its reduced model size, making it both scalable and lightweight.\nMoreover, ablation experiments offer insights into the effectiveness of the\nGaussian bias and Cartesian attention mechanism, providing recommendations for\nfurther optimizing the GeoAggregator's performance.",

In addition to traditional active anchor-based\npositioning systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have shown great\npotential for enhancing system performance.

Theoretical lower bounds are employed to analyze the impact\nof unauthorized RIS on channel parameter estimation and positioning accuracy.\nSeveral codebook design strategies for unauthorized RIS are evaluated, and\nvarious system arrangements are discussed. The simulation results show that an\nunauthorized RIS path with a high channel gain or a delay similar to that of\nlegitimate RIS paths leads to poor positioning performance. Furthermore,\nunauthorized RIS generates more effective interference when using directional\nbeamforming codebooks compared to random codebooks.",

Among these, the TV\nconstraint is widely known as a powerful prior for modeling the piecewise\nsmooth structure of subsurface properties. However, solving the optimization\nproblem is challenging because of the nonlinear observation process combined\nwith the non-smoothness of the TV constraint. Conventional methods rely on\ninner loops and\/or approximations, which lead to high computational cost and\/or\ninappropriate solutions.

    "abstract":"This study conducts a meticulous examination of the cosmological implications\ninherent in Rastall gravity and $f(R)$ gravity models, assessing their efficacy\nacross distinct cosmic epochs, from early universe structure formation to\nlate-time acceleration. In the initial stages, both models exhibit commendable\ncompatibility with observed features of structure formation, aligning with the\nestablished $\\Lambda$CDM model. The derived Jeans' wavenumbers for each model\nsupport their viability. However, as the cosmic timeline progresses into the\nlate universe, a discernible disparity surfaces. Utilizing the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method, we reconstruct the deceleration parameter $(q)$ and\nidentify Deceleration - Acceleration redshift transition values. For $f(R)$\ngravity, our results align closely with previous studies, emphasizing its\nsuperior ability to elucidate the recent cosmic acceleration. In contrast,\nRastall gravity exhibits distinct redshift transition values. Our rigorous\nanalysis underscores the prowess of $f(R)$ gravity in capturing the observed\ncosmic acceleration, positioning it as a compelling alternative to the\nconventional $\\Lambda$CDM model. The discernible shifts observed in the peaks\nof the CMB power spectrum and evolution of deceleration parameter (q) for both\n$f(R)$ gravity and Rastall gravity models in the Early and Late universe, in\nrelation to the $\\Lambda $CDM model, provide compelling evidence supporting the\nproposition that these alternative gravity models can account for the\nanisotropy of the universe without invoking the need for dark energy.",

    "abstract":"Recently, large-scale generative models have demonstrated outstanding\ntext-to-image generation capabilities. However, generating high-fidelity\npersonalized images with specific subjects still presents challenges,\nespecially in cases involving multiple subjects. In this paper, we propose\nAnyStory, a unified approach for personalized subject generation. AnyStory not\nonly achieves high-fidelity personalization for single subjects, but also for\nmultiple subjects, without sacrificing subject fidelity. Specifically, AnyStory\nmodels the subject personalization problem in an \"encode-then-route\" manner. In\nthe encoding step, AnyStory utilizes a universal and powerful image encoder,\ni.e., ReferenceNet, in conjunction with CLIP vision encoder to achieve\nhigh-fidelity encoding of subject features. In the routing step, AnyStory\nutilizes a decoupled instance-aware subject router to accurately perceive and\npredict the potential location of the corresponding subject in the latent\nspace, and guide the injection of subject conditions. Detailed experimental\nresults demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in retaining\nsubject details, aligning text descriptions, and personalizing for multiple\nsubjects.

    "abstract":"This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of Gaussian\nShading, a prevalent watermarking technique, by integrating the Exact Diffusion\nInversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) framework. While Gaussian Shading\ntraditionally embeds watermarks in a noise latent space, followed by iterative\ndenoising for image generation and noise addition for watermark recovery, its\ninversion process is not exact, leading to potential watermark distortion. We\npropose to leverage EDICT's ability to derive exact inverse mappings to refine\nthis process. Our method involves duplicating the watermark-infused noisy\nlatent and employing a reciprocal, alternating denoising and noising scheme\nbetween the two latents, facilitated by EDICT. This allows for a more precise\nreconstruction of both the image and the embedded watermark. Empirical\nevaluation on standard datasets demonstrates that our integrated approach\nyields a slight, yet statistically significant improvement in watermark\nrecovery fidelity. These results highlight the potential of EDICT to enhance\nexisting diffusion-based watermarking techniques by providing a more accurate\nand robust inversion mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to explore the synergy between EDICT and Gaussian Shading for digital\nwatermarking, opening new avenues for research in robust and high-fidelity\nwatermark embedding and extraction.",

    "abstract":"Single underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging ill-posed problem,\nbut its development is hindered by two major issues: (1) The labels in\nunderwater reference datasets are pseudo labels, relying on these pseudo ground\ntruths in supervised learning leads to domain discrepancy. (2) Underwater\nreference datasets are scarce, making training on such small datasets prone to\noverfitting and distribution shift. To address these challenges, we propose\nTrans-UIE, a transfer learning-based UIE model that captures the fundamental\nparadigms of UIE through pretraining and utilizes a dataset composed of both\nreference and non-reference datasets for fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning the\nmodel using only reconstruction loss may introduce confirmation bias. To\nmitigate this, our method leverages no-reference image quality assessment\n(NR-IQA) metrics from above-water scenes to guide the transfer learning process\nacross domains while generating enhanced images with the style of the\nabove-water image domain. Additionally, to reduce the risk of overfitting\nduring the pretraining stage, we introduce Pearson correlation loss.\nExperimental results on both full-reference and no-reference underwater\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that Trans-UIE significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract":"One-step diffusion-based image super-resolution (OSDSR) models are showing\nincreasingly superior performance nowadays. However, although their denoising\nsteps are reduced to one and they can be quantized to 8-bit to reduce the costs\nfurther, there is still significant potential for OSDSR to quantize to lower\nbits. To explore more possibilities of quantized OSDSR, we propose an efficient\nmethod, Quantization via reverse-module and timestep-retraining for OSDSR,\nnamed QArtSR. Firstly, we investigate the influence of timestep value on the\nperformance of quantized models. Then, we propose Timestep Retraining\nQuantization (TRQ) and Reversed Per-module Quantization (RPQ) strategies to\ncalibrate the quantized model. Meanwhile, we adopt the module and image losses\nto update all quantized modules. We only update the parameters in quantization\nfinetuning components, excluding the original weights. To ensure that all\nmodules are fully finetuned, we add extended end-to-end training after\nper-module stage. Our 4-bit and 2-bit quantization experimental results\nindicate that QArtSR obtains superior effects against the recent leading\ncomparison methods. The performance of 4-bit QArtSR is close to the\nfull-precision one. Our code will be released at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/libozhu03\/QArtSR.",

    "title":"Quantum generative classification with mixed states",
    "abstract":"Classification can be performed using either a discriminative or a generative\nlearning approach. Discriminative learning consists of constructing the\nconditional probability of the outputs given the inputs, while generative\nlearning consists of constructing the joint probability density of the inputs\nand outputs. Although most classical and quantum methods are discriminative,\nthere are some advantages of the generative learning approach. For instance, it\ncan be applied to unsupervised learning, statistical inference, uncertainty\nestimation, and synthetic data generation. In this article, we present a\nquantum generative multiclass classification strategy, called quantum\ngenerative classification (QGC). This model uses a variational quantum\nalgorithm to estimate the joint probability density function of features and\nlabels of a data set by means of a mixed quantum state. We also introduce a\nquantum map called quantum-enhanced Fourier features (QEFF), which leverages\nquantum superposition to prepare high-dimensional data samples in quantum\nhardware using a small number of qubits. We show that the quantum generative\nclassification algorithm can be viewed as a Gaussian mixture that reproduces a\nkernel Hilbert space of the training data. In addition, we developed a hybrid\nquantum-classical neural network that shows that it is possible to perform\ngenerative classification on high-dimensional data sets. The method was tested\non various low- and high-dimensional data sets including the 10-class MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST data sets, illustrating that the generative classification\nstrategy is competitive against other previous quantum models.",

In the context of college\nadmissions, under resource-regional caps, an admitted student may be provided\nwith a unit of some resource through a college, which belongs to a region\npossessing some amount of this resource. A student may be admitted to a college\nwith at most one unit of any resource, i.e., all resources are close\nsubstitutes, e.g., dorms on the campus, dorms outside the campus, subsidies for\nrenting a room, etc. The core feature of our model is that students are allowed\nto be admitted without any resource, which breaks heredity property of\npreviously studied models with regions.\n  It is well known that a stable matching may not exist under markets with\nregional constraints. Thus, we focus on three weakened versions of stability\nthat restore existence under resource-regional caps: envy-freeness,\nnon-wastefulness, and novel direct-envy stability. For each version of\nstability we design corresponding matching mechanism(s). Finally, we compare\nstability performances of constructed mechanisms using simulations, and\nconclude that more sophisticated direct-envy stable mechanism is the go-to\nmechanism for maximal stability of the resulting matching under\nresource-regional caps.",

    "abstract":"From observations, column density ratios or integrated intensity ratios\nbetween some species exhibit monotonic increase or decrease along with the\nevolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). Such ratios are defined\nas chemical clocks, which can be used to constrain the evolutionary stage. We\nperformed chemical simulations to reproduce the observed column density ratio\nof HC3N\/N2H+ and the abundances of these two species across various\nevolutionary stages in HMSFRs. Simultaneously, we identified the chemical\nprocesses responsible for the observed time-dependent trends in these stages.\nOur simulations utilized the astrochemical code Nautilus and the existing 1D\nmodels of HMSFRs that cover four evolutionary stages, accompanied by variations\nin density and temperature throughout the entire evolution. When averaging over\nlarge spatial scales, the best model produced successfully matches the observed\ncolumn density ratio of HC3N\/N2H+ and the abundances of the species involved at\nspecific times for each evolutionary stage; that is, the late high-mass\nstarless core stage, the early high-mass protostellar object stage, and the\nearly ultracompact HII stage. HC3N is mainly affected by the warm carbon-chain\nchemistry (WCCC) and its own thermal desorption, while N2H+ is primarily\ninfluenced by the thermal desorption of N2, CO, CH4, NH3, and H2O followed by\ndissociative recombination and ion-molecule reactions. The results obtained\nfrom the best-fitting model timescales broadly agree with statistical\nestimates. Based on our best-fit model, we further examined other 350 ratios\ninvolving 27 species, and 178 ratios exhibit an increasing or decreasing\nevolutionary trend around the best-fit timescales of HC3N\/N2H+. Among them, 157\nratios are observable and could be considered as candidate chemical clocks.",

    "abstract":"Knowledge graphs serve as critical resources supporting intelligent systems,\nbut they can be noisy due to imperfect automatic generation processes. Existing\napproaches to noise detection often rely on external facts, logical rule\nconstraints, or structural embeddings. These methods are often challenged by\nimperfect entity alignment, flexible knowledge graph construction, and\noverfitting on structures. In this paper, we propose to exploit the consistency\nbetween entity and relation type information for noise detection, resulting a\nnovel self-supervised knowledge graph denoising method that avoids those\nproblems. We formalize type inconsistency noise as triples that deviate from\nthe majority with respect to type-dependent reasoning along the topological\nstructure. Specifically, we first extract a compact representation of a given\nknowledge graph via an encoder that models the type dependencies of triples.\nThen, the decoder reconstructs the original input knowledge graph based on the\ncompact representation. It is worth noting that, our proposal has the potential\nto address the problems of knowledge graph compression and completion, although\nthis is not our focus. For the specific task of noise detection, the\ndiscrepancy between the reconstruction results and the input knowledge graph\nprovides an opportunity for denoising, which is facilitated by the type\nconsistency embedded in our method. Experimental validation demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our approach in detecting potential noise in real-world data.",

    "abstract":"Query optimization, which finds the optimized execution plan for a given\nquery, is a complex planning and decision-making problem within the\nexponentially growing plan space in database management systems (DBMS).\nTraditional optimizers heavily rely on a certain cost model constructed by\nvarious heuristics and empirical tuning, probably leading to generating\nsuboptimal plans. Recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated their potential in solving complex planning and decision-making\nproblems, such as arithmetic and programmatic tasks. In this paper, we try to\nexplore the potential of LLMs in handling query optimization and propose a\ntentative LLM-based query optimizer dubbed LLM-QO, established on PostgreSQL's\nexecution engine. In LLM-QO, we formulate query optimization in an\nautoregressive fashion which directly generates the execution plan without\nexplicit plan enumeration. To investigate the essential input of LLM-QO, we\ndesign a customized data recipe named QInstruct to collect the training data\nfrom various optimizers and serialize the database's meta data, queries and\ncorresponding plans into a textual format. Based on QInstruct, we implement a\ntwo-stage fine-tuning pipeline, Query Instruction Tuning (QIT) and Query Direct\nPreference Optimization (QDPO), to empower the capability of general-purpose\nLLMs in handling query optimization. In our experiments, LLM-QO can generate\nvalid and high-quality plans and consistently outperforms both traditional and\nlearned optimizers on three query workloads. Our findings verify that LLMs can\nbe derived as query optimizers where generalization, efficiency and adaptivity\ndeserve further research efforts.",

    "abstract":"If there is a first-order phase transition in the light quark region of\n2+1-flavor finite temperature and density QCD and if the region of the\nfirst-order phase transition expands with increasing density as suggested by\nseveral studies, then, at very high densities, we may expect that the\nfirst-order phase transition region expands into the heavy quark region of QCD,\nwhere we can perform efficient large scale simulations by adopting an effective\ntheory of heavy quark QCD based on the hopping parameter expansion. In the\nheavy quark region of QCD, we have another first-order phase transition region\naround the heavy quark limit at zero density. By numerical simulations of\neffective heavy quark QCD, we found that, the first-order transition at zero\ndensity turns into a crossover as the chemical potential is increased, but,\nwhen we increase the chemical potential further, the change in the plaquette\nvalue near the crossover point becomes much steeper. This may be suggesting\nreappearance of the first-order phase transition. In this talk, we first show\nthe nature of the phase transition of phase-quenched finite density QCD in the\nheavy quark region and then study the effect of the complex phase to discuss\nwhether the QCD phase transition changes again to a first-order phase\ntransition at very high densities.",

    "abstract":"Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream\nfor processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and\nhierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily\ndepend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the\noriginal slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution.\nRecently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language\nprior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However,\nthe previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior\nknowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance.\nMoreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very\ntime-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a\ndual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for\nwhole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual\ndescriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost\nthe performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI\nefficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder\nto aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into\nthe same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text\ndecoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image\ncontexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.",

While\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) excel in their\nrespective domains, current approaches often fail to achieve true integration\nat the reasoning level. We propose HetGCoT-Rec, a framework that deeply\nintegrates heterogeneous graph transformer with LLMs through chain-of-thought\nreasoning. Our framework features two key technical innovations: (1) a\nstructure-aware mechanism that transforms heterogeneous graph neural network\nlearned subgraph information into natural language contexts, utilizing\npredefined metapaths to capture academic relationships, and (2) a multi-step\nreasoning strategy that systematically embeds graph-derived contexts into the\nLLM's stage-wise reasoning process. Experiments on a dataset collected from\nOpenAlex demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline\nmethods, achieving 96.48% Hit rate and 92.21% H@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we\nvalidate the framework's adaptability across different LLM architectures,\nshowing consistent improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explanation\nquality.

Using both\nanalytical approach and numerical simulations, we have exactly explored the\ntransient and steady-state behavior of the particle by analyzing the simulated\nparticle trajectories, probability distribution functions for position and\nvelocity, mean square displacement, mean square velocity, and effective kinetic\ntemperature of the medium. From the mean square displacement calculations, we\nobserve that, unlike an inertial active Brownian particle, a chiral active\nparticle manifests an initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive to\nnon-diffusive, and the conventional long-time diffusive behavior. The\nintermediate sub-diffusive to non-diffusive behavior is prominent for the\nself-propulsion of an overdamped particle. It can be understood by\nchirality-induced transient confinement, which persists for short time\nintervals and diffuses away in the time asymptotic limit or at the steady\nstate. This behavior is further complemented by the exact calculation of mean\nsquare velocity or effective kinetic temperature of the medium, which is a\ndecreasing function of the magnitude of chirality. Moreover, the steady-state\nMSD and MSV are found to have a dependence both on chirality and activity time\nscale and hence can be controlled by tuning the persistent duration of activity\nor strength of the chirality of the particle.",

    "title":"UniCrossAdapter: Multimodal Adaptation of CLIP for Radiology Report\n  Generation",
    "abstract":"Automated radiology report generation aims to expedite the tedious and\nerror-prone reporting process for radiologists. While recent works have made\nprogress, learning to align medical images and textual findings remains\nchallenging due to the relative scarcity of labeled medical data. For example,\ndatasets for this task are much smaller than those used for image captioning in\ncomputer vision. In this work, we propose to transfer representations from\nCLIP, a large-scale pre-trained vision-language model, to better capture\ncross-modal semantics between images and texts. However, directly applying CLIP\nis suboptimal due to the domain gap between natural images and radiology. To\nenable efficient adaptation, we introduce UniCrossAdapter, lightweight adapter\nmodules that are incorporated into CLIP and fine-tuned on the target task while\nkeeping base parameters fixed. The adapters are distributed across modalities\nand their interaction to enhance vision-language alignment. Experiments on two\npublic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, advancing\nstate-of-the-art in radiology report generation. The proposed transfer learning\nframework provides a means of harnessing semantic knowledge from large-scale\npre-trained models to tackle data-scarce medical vision-language tasks.

Traditional memory-based approaches often overfit to limited samples,\nfailing to reinforce old knowledge, with the scarcity of data in few-shot\nscenarios further exacerbating these issues by hindering effective data\naugmentation in the latent space. In this paper, we propose a novel\nretrieval-based solution, starting with a large language model to generate\ndescriptions for each relation. From these descriptions, we introduce a\nbi-encoder retrieval training paradigm to enrich both sample and class\nrepresentation learning. Leveraging these enhanced representations, we design a\nretrieval-based prediction method where each sample \"retrieves\" the best\nfitting relation via a reciprocal rank fusion score that integrates both\nrelation description vectors and class prototypes.

    "abstract":"Context. Technical Debt (TD), defined as software constructs that are\nbeneficial in the short term but may hinder future change, is a frequently used\nterm in software development practice. Nevertheless, practitioners do not\nalways fully understand its definition and, in particular, conceptual model.\nPrevious research highlights that communication about TD is challenging,\nespecially with non-technical stakeholders. Discussions on this topic often\ncause conflicts due to misunderstandings related to other stakeholders'\nperspectives. Goal. We designed a board game to emulate TD concepts to make\nthem tangible to all stakeholders, including non-technical ones. The game aims\nto encourage discussions about TD in an emulated and safe environment, thereby\navoiding real-life conflicts. Method. To evaluate the game's effectiveness, we\nsurveyed 46 practitioners from diverse domains, positions, and experience\nlevels who played the game in 13 sessions following extensive testing during\nits development. In addition to the players' general feedback, we examined\nsituations where players recognized new insights about TD or connected game\nscenarios to real-life experiences. Results. Overall, the feedback on the game\nand its enjoyment factor were highly positive. While developers and software\narchitects often connected game situations to their real-world experiences,\nnon-technical stakeholders, such as scrum masters, product owners, and less\nexperienced developers, encountered multiple new insights on TD. Numerous\nplayers have shifted their attitudes toward TD and have outlined a plan to\nmodify their behavior regarding TD management. Conclusions. Although the game\nmay not lead to long-term behavior change among stakeholders, participants'\nfeedback provides evidence that it might serve as a valuable starting point for\nteam discussions on technical debt management.",

    "abstract":"Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due\nto their stealth and ability to mimic normal system behavior, making detection\nparticularly difficult in highly imbalanced datasets. Traditional anomaly\ndetection methods struggle to effectively differentiate APT-related activities\nfrom benign processes, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.\nThis paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection\nframework that integrates large language models (LLMs) -- BERT, ALBERT,\nDistilBERT, and RoBERTa -- with autoencoder architectures to detect APTs.\nUnlike prior approaches, which rely on manually engineered features or\nconventional anomaly detection models, APT-LLM leverages LLMs to encode\nprocess-action provenance traces into semantically rich embeddings, capturing\nnuanced behavioral patterns. These embeddings are analyzed using three\nautoencoder architectures -- Baseline Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder\n(VAE), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) -- to model normal process behavior and\nidentify anomalies. The best-performing model is selected for comparison\nagainst traditional methods. The framework is evaluated on real-world, highly\nimbalanced provenance trace datasets from the DARPA Transparent Computing\nprogram, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\\% of the data\nacross multiple operating systems (Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows) and attack\nscenarios. Results demonstrate that APT-LLM significantly improves detection\nperformance under extreme imbalance conditions, outperforming existing anomaly\ndetection methods and highlighting the effectiveness of LLM-based feature\nextraction in cybersecurity.",

    "title":"A discrete Schwarzian derivative via circle packing",
    "abstract":"There exists an extensive and fairly comprehensive discrete analytic function\ntheory which is based on circle packing. This paper introduces a faithful\ndiscrete analogue of the classical Schwarzian derivative to this theory and\ndevelops its basic properties. The motivation comes from the current lack of\ncircle packing algorithms in spherical geometry, and the discrete Schwarzian\nderivative may provide for new approaches. A companion localized notion called\nan intrinsic schwarzian is also investigated. The main concrete results of the\npaper are limited to circle packing flowers. A parameterization by intrinsic\nschwarzians is established, providing an essential packing criterion for\nflowers. The paper closes with the study of special classes of flowers that\noccur in the circle packing literature. As usual in circle packing, there are\npleasant surprises at nearly every turn, so those not interested in circle\npacking theory may still enjoy the new and elementary geometry seen in these\nflowers.",

    "abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when balancing\nmultiple high-level objectives, such as generating coherent, relevant, and\nhigh-quality responses while maintaining efficient task adaptation across\ndiverse tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce Transfer-Prompting, a\nnovel two-stage framework designed to enhance cross-task adaptation in prompt\ngeneration. The framework comprises two key components: (1) source prompt\nconstruction, which refines the original prompts on source task datasets to\ngenerate source prompts with enhanced generalization ability, and (2) target\nprompt generation, which enhances cross-task adaptation of target prompts by\nfine-tuning a set of high-scored source prompts on task-specific datasets. In\neach optimization cycle, a reference LLM generates candidate prompts based on\nhistorical prompt-score pairs and task descriptions in our designed reference\nprompt. These candidate prompts are refined iteratively, while a scorer LLM\nevaluates their effectiveness using the multi-dimensional metrics designed in\nthe objective prompts evaluator-a novel contribution in this work that provides\na holistic evaluation of prompt quality and task performance. This feedback\nloop facilitates continuous refinement, optimizing both prompt quality and\ntask-specific outcomes. We validate Transfer-Prompting through extensive\nexperiments across 25 LLMs, including 7 foundational models and 18 specialized\nmodels, evaluated on 9 diverse datasets. The results demonstrate that\nTransfer-Prompting significantly improves task-specific performance,\nhighlighting its potential for enhancing cross-task adaptation in LLMs. The\ncode is available at https:\/\/github.com\/llm172\/Transfer-Prompting.",

    "abstract":"Open-vocabulary segmentation, powered by large visual-language models like\nCLIP, has expanded 2D segmentation capabilities beyond fixed classes predefined\nby the dataset, enabling zero-shot understanding across diverse scenes.\nExtending these capabilities to 3D segmentation introduces challenges, as\nCLIP's image-based embeddings often lack the geometric detail necessary for 3D\nscene segmentation. Recent methods tend to address this by introducing\nadditional segmentation models or replacing CLIP with variations trained on\nsegmentation data, which lead to redundancy or loss on CLIP's general language\ncapabilities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SPNeRF, a NeRF based\nzero-shot 3D segmentation approach that leverages geometric priors. We\nintegrate geometric primitives derived from the 3D scene into NeRF training to\nproduce primitive-wise CLIP features, avoiding the ambiguity of point-wise\nfeatures. Additionally, we propose a primitive-based merging mechanism enhanced\nwith affinity scores. Without relying on additional segmentation models, our\nmethod further explores CLIP's capability for 3D segmentation and achieves\nnotable improvements over original LERF.",

However, existing methods for USE face challenges\ndue to limited understanding of underlying reasons for user dissatisfaction and\nthe high costs of annotating user intentions. To address these challenges, we\npropose PRAISE (Plan and Retrieval Alignment for Interpretable Satisfaction\nEstimation), an interpretable framework for effective user satisfaction\nprediction. PRAISE operates through three key modules. The Strategy Planner\ndevelops strategies, which are natural language criteria for classifying user\nsatisfaction. The Feature Retriever then incorporates knowledge on user\nsatisfaction from Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieves relevance features\nfrom utterances. Finally, the Score Analyzer evaluates strategy predictions and\nclassifies user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate that PRAISE\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks for the USE task.\nBeyond its superior performance, PRAISE offers additional benefits. It enhances\ninterpretability by providing instance-level explanations through effective\nalignment of utterances with strategies. Moreover, PRAISE operates more\nefficiently than existing approaches by eliminating the need for LLMs during\nthe inference phase.",

    "abstract":"Hickson compact groups (HCGs) offer an ideal environment for investigating\ngalaxy transformation as a result of interactions. It has been established that\nthe evolutionary sequence of HCGs is marked by an intermediate stage\ncharacterised by a substantial amount of HI in their intragroup medium (IGrM)\nin the form of tidal tails and bridges (Phase 2), rapidly followed by a final\nstage where no IGrM gas is found and where their member galaxies are highly\nHI-deficient (Phase 3). Despite numerous single-dish and interferometric HI\nstudies on the HCGs, a clear HI picture of the groups within their large-scale\nenvironment still remains to be uncovered. Taking advantage of the MeerKAT's\nhigh column density sensitivity and large field-of-view, we aim to investigate\nthe rapid transformation of HCGs from the intermediate to late phases, and\nestablish a picture of their gas content variations in the context of their\nlarge-scale environments. We performed MeerKAT observations of six HCGs\nselected to represent the intermediate and late phases of the proposed\nevolutionary sequence. Combining the HI observations with data from recent\nwide-field optical surveys, we evaluated the HI deficiencies of galaxies in a\n~30' radius of the HCGs. We find that galaxies surrounding both phases exhibit\nsimilar distributions in their gas content. Similarly, galaxies making up the\ncores of Phase 2 HCGs are comparable to their neighbours in terms of HI\ndeficiencies. However, Phase 3 groups are over an order of magnitude more\ndeficient than their surroundings, supporting previous findings that late-phase\nHCG galaxies are more evolved than their large-scale environments.",

In this framework, celestial leaf amplitudes are expressed as integrals\nover the moduli space of minitwistor lines. We construct a minitwistor\ngenerating functional for MHV leaf amplitudes using the Quillen determinant\nline bundle, extending the approach originally developed by Boels, Mason and\nSkinner.

    "abstract":"The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing and other assay\ntechnologies has resulted in the generation of large and complex multi-omics\ndatasets, offering unprecedented opportunities for advancing precision medicine\nstrategies. However, multi-omics data integration presents significant\nchallenges due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, experimental gaps,\nand frequency of missing values across data types. Computational methods have\nbeen developed to address these issues, employing statistical and machine\nlearning approaches to uncover complex biological patterns and provide deeper\ninsights into our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively\nreview state-of-the-art multi-omics data integration methods with a focus on\ndeep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) that have\nbeen widely used for data imputation and augmentation, joint embedding\ncreation, and batch effect correction. We explore the technical aspects of loss\nfunctions and regularisation techniques including adversarial training,\ndisentanglement and contrastive learning. Moreover, we discuss recent\nadvancements in foundation models and the integration of emerging data\nmodalities, while describing the current limitations and outlining future\ndirections for enhancing multi-modal methodologies in biomedical research.",

    "abstract":"Recent studies have shown associations between redlining policies (1935-1974)\nand present-day fine particulate matter (PM$_{2.5}$) and nitrogen dioxide\n(NO$_2$) air pollution concentrations. In this paper, we reevaluate these\nassociations using spatial causal inference. Redlining policies enacted in the\n1930s, so there is very limited documentation of pre-treatment covariates.\nConsequently, traditional methods fails to sufficiently account for unmeasured\nconfounders, potentially biasing causal interpretations. By integrating\nhistorical redlining data with 2010 PM$_{2.5}$ and NO$_2$ concentrations, our\nstudy aims to discern whether a causal link exists. Our study addresses\nchallenges with a novel spatial and non-spatial latent factor framework, using\nthe unemployment rate, house rent and percentage of Black population in 1940\nU.S. Census as proxies to reconstruct pre-treatment latent socio-economic\nstatus. We establish identification of a causal effect under broad assumptions,\nand use Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to quantify uncertainty. Our analysis\nindicates that historically redlined neighborhoods are exposed to notably\nhigher NO$_2$ concentration. In contrast, the disparities in PM$_{2.5}$ between\nthese neighborhoods are less pronounced. Among the cities analyzed, Los\nAngeles, CA, and Atlanta, GA, demonstrate the most significant effects for both\nNO$_2$ and PM$_{2.5}$.",

In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel\nontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT\ndirectly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured\nrepresentations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the\nontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art\ngraph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a\nquestion-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable\nfor question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is\nchallenging.

Full-text annotations\nyielded the highest comprehension accuracy across all languages, while\npreferences diverged: English readers favored highly annotated charts, whereas\nTamil\/Arabic readers preferred full-text or minimally annotated versions.\nSemantic variations in annotations (L1-L4) did not significantly affect\ncomprehension, demonstrating the robustness of text comprehension across\nlanguages. English annotations were generally preferred, with a tendency to\nthink technically in English linked to greater aversion to non-English\nannotations, though this diminished among participants who regularly switched\nlanguages internally. Non-English annotations incorporating visual or external\nknowledge were less favored, particularly in titles.

Our preprocessing\ntechniques ensure high data accuracy and comprehensiveness, enabling a more\nreliable impact fall detection. Extensive experiments were conducted using\nvarious machine learning and deep learning algorithms to benchmark the improved\n3D skeletons dataset. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in the\nperformance of fall detection models trained on the enhanced dataset. This\ncontribution aims to enhance the safety and well-being of the elderly\npopulation at risk. To support further research and development of building\nmore reliable impact fall detection systems, we have made the improved 3D\nskeletons UP-Fall dataset publicly available at this link\nhttps:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/12773013.",

    "abstract":"We examine a controlled school choice model where students are categorized\ninto different types, and the distribution of these types within a school\ninfluences its priority structure. This study provides a general framework that\nintegrates existing controlled school choice models, including those utilizing\nreserve rules, quota rules, and bonus-point rules. Specifically, we introduce\nan adjusted scoring rule that unifies these rules. By achieving a matching that\nsatisfies the stability defined in this framework, matching authorities can\neffectively manage the trade-offs inherent in controlled school choice markets.\nMoreover, the priority order for a school is represented as a weak order with\neach given assignment, meaning that ties are allowed. Our mechanism ensures a\nstable matching and satisfies strategy-proofness. In particular, when priority\norders are restricted to linear orders with each given assignment, our\nmechanism guarantees student-optimal stability.",

    "title":"Resolving Jeffreys-Lindley Paradox",
    "abstract":"Jeffreys-Lindley paradox is a case where frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis\ntesting methodologies contradict with each other. This has caused confusion\namong data analysts for selecting a methodology for their statistical inference\ntasks. Though the paradox goes back to mid 1930's so far there hasn't been a\nsatisfactory resolution given for it. In this paper we show that it arises\nmainly due to the simple fact that, in the frequentist approach, the difference\nbetween the hypothesized parameter value and the observed estimate of the\nparameter is assessed in terms of the standard error of the estimate, no matter\nwhat the actual numerical difference is and how small the standard error is,\nwhereas in the Bayesian methodology it has no effect due to the definition of\nthe Bayes factor in the context, even though such an assessment is present. In\nfact, the paradox is an instance of conflict between statistical and practical\nsignificance and a result of using a sharp null hypothesis to approximate an\nacceptable small range of values for the parameter. Occurrence of type-I error\nthat is allowed in frequentist methodology plays important role in the paradox.\nTherefore, the paradox is not a conflict between two inference methodologies\nbut an instance of not agreeing their conclusions",

    "title":"Label-Efficient LiDAR Semantic Segmentation with 2D-3D Vision\n  Transformer Adapters",
    "abstract":"LiDAR semantic segmentation models are typically trained from random\ninitialization as universal pre-training is hindered by the lack of large,\ndiverse datasets. Moreover, most point cloud segmentation architectures\nincorporate custom network layers, limiting the transferability of advances\nfrom vision-based architectures. Inspired by recent advances in universal\nfoundation models, we propose BALViT, a novel approach that leverages frozen\nvision models as amodal feature encoders for learning strong LiDAR encoders.\nSpecifically, BALViT incorporates both range-view and bird's-eye-view LiDAR\nencoding mechanisms, which we combine through a novel 2D-3D adapter. While the\nrange-view features are processed through a frozen image backbone, our\nbird's-eye-view branch enhances them through multiple cross-attention\ninteractions. Thereby, we continuously improve the vision network with\ndomain-dependent knowledge, resulting in a strong label-efficient LiDAR\nencoding mechanism. Extensive evaluations of BALViT on the SemanticKITTI and\nnuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nsmall data regimes.

    "title":"Quantitative Magnetohydrodynamic Modelling of Flux Pumping in ASDEX\n  Upgrade",
    "abstract":"The sawtooth-free hybrid scenario has been achieved recently in ASDEX Upgrade\n(AUG) with applied non-inductive current sources and auxiliary heating [A.\nBurckhart et al 2023 Nucl. Fusion 63 126056]. Control experiments in AUG\nsuggest that the self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism, characterized\nby anomalous current redistribution, is responsible for clamping the central\nsafety factor (q_0) close to unity, thereby preventing the sawtooth onset. This\nwork presents a numerical and theoretical investigation of flux pumping in the\nAUG hybrid scenario based on the two-temperature, visco-resistive, full\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model with the JOREK code. To quantitatively model\nthe flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and\nsource terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of\nthe unstable 1\/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0\nexhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity,\nwhich is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo\neffect on the order of V\/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of\nseconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV\/m induced by the\n1\/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides\nquantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The\nfinal saturated 1\/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange\nmode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a\nfew m\/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly\noffsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current\ndensity and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the\nlow-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the\nsystem enters a sawtooth-free and quasi-stationary helical state.",

    "abstract":"We present results of one-dimensional collisionless simulations of plasma\nturbulence and related anomalous electron current of the Electron Cyclotron\nDrift Instability (ECDI). Our highly resolved, long-term simulations of xenon\nplasma in the magnetic field performed with the WarpX particle-in-cell (PIC)\ncode show several intermediate non-linear stages before the system enters a\nstationary state with significantly increased electron temperature and a finite\nlevel of energy in the electrostatic fluctuations. In early and intermediate\nnon-linear stages, the fluctuations are driven by the electron cyclotron\nresonances gradually shifting from higher ($m>1$) modes to the fundamental\n$m=1$ resonance. Enhanced resonant growth is observed from the point when the\ncyclotron $m=1$ mode coincides with the most unstable ion-acoustic mode. In the\nfinal stage, the anomalous electron current existing in intermediate stages is\nquenched to zero. Following this quenching, our simulations reveal a transition\nfrom ECDI-driven dynamics to saturated ion-acoustic turbulence. The\nmodification of the electron and ion distribution functions and their roles in\nthe non-linear developments and saturation of the instability are analyzed at\ndifferent non-linear stages. The non-linear development of ECDI driven by the\n$\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ electron drift from the applied current and the\nECDI driven by the ion beam perpendicular to the magnetic field are compared\nand characterized as two perspectives of the instability, observed through\ndifferent Doppler-shifted frames. An extension of this work incorporating full\nthe dynamics of magnetized ions for ECDI driven by a hydrogen ion beam is shown\nto develop full beam inversion, with the periodic bursts of growth-saturation\ncycles of ECDI.",

    "title":"The impact of job stability on monetary poverty in Italy: causal small\n  area estimation",
    "abstract":"Job stability - encompassing secure contracts, adequate wages, social\nbenefits, and career opportunities - is a critical determinant in reducing\nmonetary poverty, as it provides households with reliable income and enhances\neconomic well-being. This study leverages EU-SILC survey and census data to\nestimate the causal effect of job stability on monetary poverty across Italian\nprovinces, quantifying its influence and analyzing regional disparities. We\nintroduce a novel causal small area estimation (CSAE) framework that integrates\nglobal and local estimation strategies for heterogeneous treatment effect\nestimation, effectively addressing data sparsity at the provincial level.\nFurthermore, we develop a general bootstrap scheme to construct reliable\nconfidence intervals, applicable regardless of the method used for estimating\nnuisance parameters. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed\nestimators outperform classical causal inference methods in terms of stability\nwhile maintaining computational scalability for large datasets. Applying this\nmethodology to real-world data, we uncover significant relationships between\njob stability and poverty across six Italian regions, offering critical\ninsights into regional disparities and their implications for evidence-based\npolicy design.",

The goal is to compute a minimum weight basis for each possible\ncombination of the parameters. For this problem, we propose an algorithm that\nrequires a polynomial number of independence tests and discuss two useful\napplications. First, the algorithm can be applied to solve a multi-parametric\nversion of a special matroid interdiction problem, and second, it can be\nutilized to compute the weight set decomposition of the multi-objective\n(graphic) matroid problem.

Interpolation grids facilitate an almost instant re-evaluation of\ntheory predictions for different input parton distributions functions (PDFs) or\nscale settings and are thus indispensable in the study of the parton content of\nthe proton. While interpolation grids at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)\nexist for some key processes relevant for PDF determinations, a notable\nexception is the Drell-Yan process that constitutes the production of\nelectroweak gauge bosons at hadron colliders and provides important constraints\non the quark content of the proton. To address this gap, we report on a new\ninterface between the parton-level Monte Carlo generator NNLOJET and the\ninterpolation grid library PINEAPPL and demonstrate its use for the Drell-Yan\nprocess. Accompanying this note, we release Drell-Yan grids covering a wide\nrange of measurements that commonly enter global determinations of PDFs.

    "abstract":"Alternating shear rotations in dense suspensions have recently shown the\nability to reduce both viscosity and dissipation per strain (at a fixed global\nshear rate). Here, we study alternating shear rotation, with extensive\nnumerical simulations, at various angles and up to their corresponding jamming\npoints. For increasing shear rotation angles, we find that the jamming point is\ncontinuously shifted to higher packing fractions for frictional particles,\nwhile it remains constant for frictionless particles. As a consequence, the\nalternating shear rotation is unable to reduce the dissipation per strain for\nsuspensions composed of frictionless particles. We detail the individual\ncontributions, hydrodynamic or contact, to the shear stress, being uncharted\nfor this protocol. As the angle of rotation increases, the average contact\nstress decreases. However, we find that the hydrodynamics shows the opposite\ntrend, instead increasing with increasing angle. Hence, hydrodynamic stress\nwill dominate up to much higher packing fractions as the angle of rotation\nincreases. In addition, we report how the microstructure varies and establish a\none-to-one mapping between the contact number and its contribution to the total\nstress for both frictionless and frictional particles.",

    "abstract":"Associations between phenotype and genomic and epigenomic markers are often\nderived by correlation. Systems Biology aims to make more robust connections\nand uncover broader insights by modeling the cellular mechanisms that produce a\nphenotype. The question of choosing the modeling methodology is of central\nimportance. A model that does not capture biological reality closely enough\nwill not explain the system's behavior. At the same time, highly detailed\nmodels suffer from computational limitations and are likely to overfit the\ndata. Boolean networks strike a balance between complexity and descriptiveness\nand thus have received increasing interest. We previously described an\nalgorithm for fitting Boolean networks to high-throughout experimental data\nthat finds the optimal network with respect to the information in a given\ndataset. In this work, we describe a simple extension that enables the modeling\nof asynchronous dynamics, i.e. different reaction times for different network\nnodes. In addition, we present a new method for pseudo-time assignment for\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing data that is derived from the modeling procedure.\nOur approach greatly simplifies the construction of Boolean network models for\ntime-series datasets, where asynchronicity often occurs. We demonstrate our\nmethodology by integrating real data from transcriptomics experiments. These\nresults significantly expand the applicability of the Boolean network model to\nexperimental data.",

    "abstract":"Individual stars located near the caustics of galaxy clusters can undergo\nextreme magnification when crossing micro-caustics, rendering them observable\neven at cosmological distances. Though most massive stars are likely reside in\nbinary systems rather than as single star, the influence of binary star system\non magnification events is severely under-explored. In this work, we simulate\nthe light curves produced by detached binary stars crossing micro-caustics,\naiming to characterize their unique observational signatures.Using\nhigh-resolution magnification maps generated by the GPU-PMO-CAUSTIC algorithm\nand PARSEC stellar models with red-shifted magnitude, we examined the impact of\nbinary star parameters and crossing geometries on microlensing magnification\npatterns. Our simulations reveal that binary stars produce diverse light curve\nfeatures, including overlapping peaks, plateau-like structures, and\ntime-variable color-magnitude differences. These features, particularly the\ndistinct temporal variations in spectral energy distributions, offer diagnostic\ntools for distinguishing binary systems from single stars.We further\ndemonstrate the potential of multi-band photometry using the Chinese Space\nStation Telescope's Multi-Channel Imager (CSST-MCI) to capture these\nvariations.Our findings provide theoretical support for identifying binary\nsystems in future caustic-crossing events, enabling more accurate\ncharacterization of high-redshift stellar populations.",

    "title":"An Empirical Study on Commit Message Generation using LLMs via\n  In-Context Learning",
    "abstract":"Commit messages concisely describe code changes in natural language and are\nimportant for software maintenance. Several approaches have been proposed to\nautomatically generate commit messages, but they still suffer from critical\nlimitations, such as time-consuming training and poor generalization ability.\nTo tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language\nmodels (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). Our intuition is based on the fact\nthat the training corpora of LLMs contain extensive code changes and their\npairwise commit messages, which makes LLMs capture the knowledge about commits,\nwhile ICL can exploit the knowledge hidden in the LLMs and enable them to\nperform downstream tasks without model tuning. However, it remains unclear how\nwell LLMs perform on commit message generation via ICL. In this paper, we\nconduct an empirical study to investigate the capability of LLMs to generate\ncommit messages via ICL. Specifically, we first explore the impact of different\nsettings on the performance of ICL-based commit message generation. We then\ncompare ICL-based commit message generation with state-of-the-art approaches on\na popular multilingual dataset and a new dataset we created to mitigate\npotential data leakage. The results show that ICL-based commit message\ngeneration significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on subjective\nevaluation and achieves better generalization ability. We further analyze the\nroot causes for LLM's underperformance and propose several implications, which\nshed light on future research directions for using LLMs to generate commit\nmessages.",

    "abstract":"Recent advances in interactive 3D segmentation from 2D images have\ndemonstrated impressive performance. However, current models typically require\nextensive scene-specific training to accurately reconstruct and segment\nobjects, which limits their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this\npaper, we introduce WildSeg3D, an efficient approach that enables the\nsegmentation of arbitrary 3D objects across diverse environments using a\nfeed-forward mechanism. A key challenge of this feed-forward approach lies in\nthe accumulation of 3D alignment errors across multiple 2D views, which can\nlead to inaccurate 3D segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose\nDynamic Global Aligning (DGA), a technique that improves the accuracy of global\nmulti-view alignment by focusing on difficult-to-match 3D points across images,\nusing a dynamic adjustment function. Additionally, for real-time interactive\nsegmentation, we introduce Multi-view Group Mapping (MGM), a method that\nutilizes an object mask cache to integrate multi-view segmentations and respond\nrapidly to user prompts. WildSeg3D demonstrates robust generalization across\narbitrary scenes, thereby eliminating the need for scene-specific training.\nSpecifically, WildSeg3D not only attains the accuracy of state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods but also achieves a $40\\times$ speedup compared to existing SOTA\nmodels.

    "abstract":"Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing but\nface significant challenges of high storage and runtime costs, due to the\ntransformer architecture's reliance on self-attention, particularly the large\nKey-Value (KV) cache for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts to reduce KV\ncache size by pruning less critical entries based on attention weights remain\nempirical and lack formal grounding. This paper presents a formal study on\nidentifying critical KV cache entries by analyzing attention output\nperturbation. Our analysis reveals that, beyond attention weights, the value\nstates within KV entries and pretrained parameter matrices are also crucial.\nBased on this, we propose a perturbation-constrained selection algorithm that\noptimizes the worst-case output perturbation to identify critical entries.\nEvaluations on the Needle-in-a-Haystack test and Longbench benchmark show our\nalgorithm enhances state-of-the-art cache eviction methods. Further empirical\nanalysis confirms that our algorithm achieves lower output perturbations in\nover 92% attention heads in Llama model, thereby providing a significant\nimprovement over existing methods.",

One\ncandidate, Convective Overstability (COS), can be triggered in regions with a\nnegative radial entropy gradient. The ensuing turbulence and flow structures\nare expected to affect dust dynamics directly. We revisit the interaction\nbetween dust and the COS with high-resolution spectral simulations in the\nunstratified, axisymmetric Boussinesq shearing box framework. We find zonal\nflows, or pressure bumps, formed by the COS trap dust, as expected, but dust\ndensities increase at most by a factor of $O(10)$ over its background value due\nto the zonal flows' unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the\nformation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\\epsilon \\sim\nO(0.1)$. We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas\nangular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive\ndust angular momentum flux associated with its drift towards pressure maxima.\nDust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure\ngradient induces a background dust drift. Ultimately, we find that dust\nconcentration by COS-induced zonal flows is limited to $\\epsilon \\lesssim 1$.\nWhether this can be improved under more realistic geometries must be addressed\nwith stratified and full 3D simulations at equivalent resolutions.",

    "abstract":"Code generation models have shown significant potential for automating\nprogramming tasks. However, the challenge of generating accurate and reliable\ncode persists due to the highly complex and long-reasoning nature of the task.\nEven state-of-the-art models often fail in code generation due to small errors,\nwhich can drastically affect the overall functionality of code. Our study\nidentifies that current models tend to produce errors concentrated at specific\nerror-prone points, which significantly impacts the accuracy of the generated\ncode. To address this issue, we introduce Focused-DPO, a framework that\nenhances code generation by directing preference optimization towards these\ncritical error-prone areas. This approach builds on Direct Preference\nOptimization, emphasizing accuracy in parts prone to errors. Additionally, we\ndevelop a method called Error-Point Identification, which constructs a dataset\nthat targets these problematic points without requiring costly human\nannotations. Our experiments on benchmarks such as HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), and\nLiveCodeBench demonstrate that Focused-DPO significantly improves the precision\nand reliability of code generation, reducing common errors and enhancing\noverall code quality.

    "abstract":"Self-attention mechanisms have revolutionised deep learning architectures,\nyet their core mathematical structures remain incompletely understood. In this\nwork, we develop a category-theoretic framework focusing on the linear\ncomponents of self-attention. Specifically, we show that the query, key, and\nvalue maps naturally define a parametric 1-morphism in the 2-category\n$\\mathbf{Para(Vect)}$. On the underlying 1-category $\\mathbf{Vect}$, these maps\ninduce an endofunctor whose iterated composition precisely models multi-layer\nattention. We further prove that stacking multiple self-attention layers\ncorresponds to constructing the free monad on this endofunctor. For positional\nencodings, we demonstrate that strictly additive embeddings correspond to\nmonoid actions in an affine sense, while standard sinusoidal encodings, though\nnot additive, retain a universal property among injective (faithful)\nposition-preserving maps. We also establish that the linear portions of\nself-attention exhibit natural equivariance to permutations of input tokens,\nand show how the \"circuits\" identified in mechanistic interpretability can be\ninterpreted as compositions of parametric 1-morphisms. This categorical\nperspective unifies geometric, algebraic, and interpretability-based approaches\nto transformer analysis, making explicit the underlying structures of\nattention. We restrict to linear maps throughout, deferring the treatment of\nnonlinearities such as softmax and layer normalisation, which require more\nadvanced categorical constructions. Our results build on and extend recent work\non category-theoretic foundations for deep learning, offering deeper insights\ninto the algebraic structure of attention mechanisms.",

    "abstract":"Reconstructing an object's shape and appearance in terms of a mesh textured\nby a spatially-varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF)\nfrom a limited set of images captured under collocated light is an ill-posed\nproblem. Previous state-of-the-art approaches either aim to reconstruct the\nappearance directly on the geometry or additionally use texture normals as part\nof the appearance features. However, this requires detailed but inefficiently\nlarge meshes, that would have to be simplified in a post-processing step, or\nsuffers from well-known limitations of normal maps such as missing shadows or\nincorrect silhouettes. Another limiting factor is the fixed and typically low\nresolution of the texture estimation resulting in loss of important surface\ndetails. To overcome these problems, we present ROSA, an inverse rendering\nmethod that directly optimizes mesh geometry with spatially adaptive mesh\nresolution solely based on the image data. In particular, we refine the mesh\nand locally condition the surface smoothness based on the estimated normal\ntexture and mesh curvature. In addition, we enable the reconstruction of fine\nappearance details in high-resolution textures through a pioneering tile-based\nmethod that operates on a single pre-trained decoder network but is not limited\nby the network output resolution.",

Performing this analysis in a\ncost-efficient manner requires using machine learning (ML) models to extract\nthe semantic information and subsequently analyze the now structured data.\nHowever, this process remains challenging for domain experts.\n  To demonstrate the challenges in social science analytics, we collect a\ndataset, QUIET-ML, of 120 real-world social science queries in natural language\nand their ground truth answers. Existing systems struggle with these queries\nsince (1) they require selecting and applying ML models, and (2) more than a\nquarter of these queries are vague, making standard tools like natural language\nto SQL systems unsuited. To address these issues, we develop LEAP, an\nend-to-end library that answers social science queries in natural language with\nML. LEAP filters vague queries to ensure that the answers are deterministic and\nselects from internally supported and user-defined ML functions to extend the\nunstructured data to structured tables with necessary annotations.

(2)\nCross-modality alignment. (3) Error accumulation in autoregressive frameworks.\nTo address these challenges, we proposed LangTime, a language-guided unified\nmodel for time series forecasting that incorporates cross-domain pre-training\nwith reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning. Specifically, LangTime\nconstructs Temporal Comprehension Prompts (TCPs), which include dataset-wise\nand channel-wise instructions, to facilitate domain adaptation and condense\ntime series into a single token, enabling LLMs to understand better and align\ntemporal data. To improve autoregressive forecasting, we introduce TimePPO, a\nreinforcement learning-based fine-tuning algorithm. TimePPO mitigates error\naccumulation by leveraging a multidimensional rewards function tailored for\ntime series and a repeat-based value estimation strategy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that LangTime achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain forecasting\nperformance, while TimePPO fine-tuning effectively enhances the stability and\naccuracy of autoregressive forecasting.",

    "abstract":"Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are known to more frequently\ngenerate non-faithful output in resource-constrained languages (Guerreiro et\nal., 2023 - arXiv:2303.16104), potentially because these typologically diverse\nlanguages are underrepresented in their training data. To mitigate\nunfaithfulness in such settings, we propose using computationally light\nauxiliary models to rescore the outputs of larger architectures. As proof of\nthe feasibility of such an approach, we show that monolingual 4-layer BERT\nmodels pretrained from scratch on less than 700 MB of data without fine-tuning\nare able to identify faithful summaries with a mean accuracy of 88.33% in three\ngenetically unrelated languages that differ in their morphological complexity -\nVietnamese, Polish and Georgian. The same hyperparameter combination moreover\ngeneralises well to three other tasks, suggesting applications for rescoring\nbeyond improving faithfulness. In order to inform typologically aware model\nselection, we also investigate how morphological complexity interacts with\nregularisation, model depth and training objectives, ultimately demonstrating\nthat morphologically complex languages are more likely to benefit from dropout,\nwhile across languages downstream performance is enhanced most by shallow\narchitectures as well as training using the standard BERT objectives.",

The percolation model is constructed on a\ndual lattice where the sites on the primal lattice represent the grains of the\nporous medium, and the bonds on the dual lattice represent the pores in between\nthe grains. The bonds on the dual lattice are occupied based on the two\nadjacent sites on the primal lattice, which represent the pores where the\ncapillary forces average to zero. The spanning cluster of the bonds, therefore,\nrepresents the flow network through which the two immiscible fluids can flow\nwithout facing any capillary barrier. It turns out to be a percolation\ntransition of the perimeters of a site percolation problem. We study the\ngeometrical properties at the criticality of the perimeter system numerically.\nA scaling theory is developed for these properties, and their scaling relations\nwith the respective density parameters are studied. We also verified their\nfinite-size scaling relations.

    "abstract":"Continual learning is the process of training machine learning models on a\nsequence of tasks where data distributions change over time. A well-known\nobstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon in which a\nmodel drastically loses performance on previously learned tasks when learning\nnew ones. A popular strategy to alleviate this problem is experience replay, in\nwhich a subset of old samples is stored in a memory buffer and replayed with\nnew data. Despite continual learning advances focusing on which examples to\nstore and how to incorporate them into the training loss, most approaches\nassume that sampling from this buffer is uniform by default.\n  We challenge the assumption that uniform sampling is necessarily optimal. We\nconduct an experiment in which the memory buffer updates the same way in every\ntrial, but the replay probability of each stored sample changes between trials\nbased on different random weight distributions. Specifically, we generate 50\ndifferent non-uniform sampling probability weights for each trial and compare\ntheir final accuracy to the uniform sampling baseline. We find that there is\nalways at least one distribution that significantly outperforms the baseline\nacross multiple buffer sizes, models, and datasets. These results suggest that\nmore principled adaptive replay policies could yield further gains. We discuss\nhow exploiting this insight could inspire new research on non-uniform memory\nsampling in continual learning to better mitigate catastrophic forgetting.\n  The code supporting this study is available at\n$\\href{https:\/\/github.com\/DentonJC\/memory-sampling}{https:\/\/github.com\/DentonJC\/memory-sampling}$.",

    "abstract":"Face information is mainly concentrated among facial key points, and frontier\nresearch has begun to use graph neural networks to segment faces into patches\nas nodes to model complex face representations. However, these methods\nconstruct node-to-node relations based on similarity thresholds, so there is a\nproblem that some latent relations are missing. These latent relations are\ncrucial for deep semantic representation of face aging. In this novel, we\npropose a new Latent Relation-Aware Graph Neural Network with Initial and\nDynamic Residual (LRA-GNN) to achieve robust and comprehensive facial\nrepresentation. Specifically, we first construct an initial graph utilizing\nfacial key points as prior knowledge, and then a random walk strategy is\nemployed to the initial graph for obtaining the global structure, both of which\ntogether guide the subsequent effective exploration and comprehensive\nrepresentation. Then LRA-GNN leverages the multi-attention mechanism to capture\nthe latent relations and generates a set of fully connected graphs containing\nrich facial information and complete structure based on the aforementioned\nguidance. To avoid over-smoothing issues for deep feature extraction on the\nfully connected graphs, the deep residual graph convolutional networks are\ncarefully designed, which fuse adaptive initial residuals and dynamic\ndevelopmental residuals to ensure the consistency and diversity of information.\nFinally, to improve the estimation accuracy and generalization ability,\nprogressive reinforcement learning is proposed to optimize the ensemble\nclassification regressor. Our proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art\nbaselines on several age estimation benchmarks, demonstrating its strength and\neffectiveness.",

    "abstract":"Graph condensation reduces the size of large graphs while preserving\nperformance, addressing the scalability challenges of Graph Neural Networks\ncaused by computational inefficiencies on large datasets. Existing methods\noften rely on bi-level optimization, requiring extensive GNN training and\nlimiting their scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes Graph\nCondensation via Gaussian Process (GCGP), a novel and computationally efficient\napproach to graph condensation. GCGP utilizes a Gaussian Process (GP), with the\ncondensed graph serving as observations, to estimate the posterior distribution\nof predictions. This approach eliminates the need for the iterative and\nresource-intensive training typically required by GNNs. To enhance the\ncapability of the GCGP in capturing dependencies between function values, we\nderive a specialized covariance function that incorporates structural\ninformation. This covariance function broadens the receptive field of input\nnodes by local neighborhood aggregation, thereby facilitating the\nrepresentation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the\nchallenge of optimizing binary structural information in condensed graphs,\nConcrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency\nmatrix in a continuous counterpart. This relaxation process allows the\nadjacency matrix to be represented in a differentiable form, enabling the\napplication of gradient-based optimization techniques to discrete graph\nstructures. Experimental results show that the proposed GCGP method efficiently\ncondenses large-scale graph data while preserving predictive performance,\naddressing the scalability and efficiency challenges.

In this paper, we\nfactorize internal state variables and mathematical properties as \"cognitive\ndissonance\" in shared control paradigms, where human interventions occasionally\noccur.

Declarative and procedural knowledge extracted from\nhuman semantic inputs is encoded into a hypergraph model that overlaps with the\nspatial configuration of onsite layout for path planning. In addition, we\ndesign a velocity-replay module using an encoder-decoder architecture with\nfew-shot learning to enable robots to replicate velocity profiles in\ncontextualized scenarios for multi-robot synchronization and handover\ncollaboration.

Based on the three level\nof scenario abstraction theory, a testing can be performed within a logical\nscenario, followed by an evaluation stage which is inputted with the testing\nresults of each concrete scenario generated from the logical parameter space.\nDuring the above process, abundant testing information is produced which is\nbeneficial for comprehensive and accurate evaluations. To make full use of\ntesting information, this paper proposes an Integrated accelerated Testing and\nEvaluation Method (ITEM). Based on a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) paradigm\nand a dual surrogates testing framework proposed in our previous work, this\npaper applies the intermediate information (i.e., the tree structure, including\nthe affiliation of each historical sampled point with the subspaces and the\nparent-child relationship between subspaces) generated during the testing stage\ninto the evaluation stage to achieve accurate hazardous domain identification.\nMoreover, to better serve this purpose, the UCB calculation method is improved\nto allow the search algorithm to focus more on the hazardous domain boundaries.\nFurther, a stopping condition is constructed based on the convergence of the\nsearch algorithm. Ablation and comparative experiments are then conducted to\nverify the effectiveness of the improvements and the superiority of the\nproposed method. The experimental results show that ITEM could well identify\nthe hazardous domains in both low- and high-dimensional cases, regardless of\nthe shape of the hazardous domains, indicating its generality and potential for\nthe safety evaluation of ADSs.",

In this work, we present the\nanalysis of solar wind outflows from two locations: a narrow open-field\ncorridor and a small, mid-latitude coronal hole. These outflows were observed\noff-limb by the Metis coronagraph onboard SO and on-disk by the Extreme\nUltraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. Magnetic field\nextrapolations suggest that the upflow regions seen in EIS were the sources of\nthe outflowing solar wind observed with Metis. We find that the plasma\nassociated with the narrow open-field corridor has higher electron densities\nand lower outflow velocities compared to the coronal hole plasma in the middle\ncorona, even though the plasma properties of the two source regions in the low\ncorona are found to be relatively similar. The speed of solar wind from the\nopen-field corridor also shows no correlation with the magnetic field expansion\nfactor, unlike the coronal hole. These pronounced differences at higher\naltitudes may arise from the dynamic nature of the low-middle corona, in which\nreconnection can readily occur and may play an important role in driving solar\nwind variability.",

    "abstract":"Through Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) analysis, valuable information can be\nprovided about the role of defect traps in fine tuning and reading of the state\nof a nanoelectronic device. However, time domain analysis techniques exhibit\ntheir limitations in case where unstable RTN signals occur. These instabilities\nare a common issue in Multi-Level Cells (MLC) of resistive memories (ReRAM),\nwhen the tunning protocol fails to find a perfectly stable resistance state,\nwhich in turn brings fluctuations to the RTN signal especially in long time\nmeasurements and cause severe errors in the estimation of the distribution of\ntime constants of the observed telegraphic events, i.e., capture\/emission of\ncarriers from traps. In this work, we analyze the case of the unstable\nfilaments in silicon nitride-based ReRAM devices and propose an adaptive filter\nimplementing a moving-average detrending method in order to flatten unstable\nRTN signals and increase sufficiently the accuracy of the conducted\nmeasurements. The te and tc emission\/capture time constants of the traps,\nrespectively, are then calculated and a cross-validation through frequency\ndomain analysis (Lorentzian fitting) was performed proving that the proposed\nmethod is accurate.",

    "abstract":"Wealth transactions are central to economic activity, and their\nparticularities shape macroeconomic outcomes. We propose an agent-based model\nto investigate how homophily influences economic inequality. The model\nsimulates wealth exchanges in a dynamic network composed of two groups, $A$ and\n$B$, differentiated by a homophily parameter $\\delta$, which increases\nintragroup connections within $A$. Economic interactions alternate between\nconservative wealth exchanges and connection rewiring, both influenced by\nagents' wealth and $\\delta$. We examine economic and network dynamics under\nvarying levels of social protection $f$, which favor poorer agents in\ntransactions. At low $f$, results reveal high inequality and link\nconcentration, with $\\delta$ impacting only transient dynamics. At high $f$,\nhomophily becomes an economic advantage, as increasing $\\delta$ directs wealth\nflow to group $A$. However, since this flow benefits the wealthiest agents, it\nsimultaneously exacerbates internal inequality within the group. These findings\nshow that homophily is a significant driver of inequality, directing wealth\ntowards the homophilous group and worsening internal disparities.",

    "abstract":"Pathology foundation models (PFMs) extract valuable discriminative features\nfrom images for downstream clinical tasks. PFMs have simplified the development\nof deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve\ndiagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes\nstruggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are\noften contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e.,\ninstitution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination\ncan lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization\nability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first\nreveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of\ninstitution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts,\nanalyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions.\nSpecifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in\npathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant\ninformation, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance\non contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This\nindicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We\nfurther delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific\ninformation and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet\neffective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This\nstudy is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly\nadvanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire\nfuture research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying\nexclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.",

The notes present an\naccessible and self-contained account of the strongest results known at the\ntime in connection with these problems; this includes a number of ideas that\nhave not appeared elsewhere. In the last section, Herzog turns his attention to\nthe cotangent complex, and conjectures himself that if the cotangent complex of\na local ring has bounded homology groups, then the ring must be complete\nintersection. Among other results, he proves that the conjecture holds for\nlocal rings of characteristic zero over which all modules have rational\nPoincar\\'e series.\n  Sadly J\\\"urgen Herzog passed away in April of 2024.

    "abstract":"This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some\nelements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum\ntheory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the\nwave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex\nprobability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real\nforward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two\nquasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the\nBorn rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability\nsets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for\nexplaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that\nproduces this so-called \"wave-like\" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective\nalso challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental\nconcept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of\nquantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of\nstochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the\nappearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum\nbehavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a\nprobabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic\nhidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight\ninto the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for\na novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract":"Instance selection (IS) is important in machine learning for reducing dataset\nsize while keeping key characteristics. Current IS methods often struggle with\ncapturing complex relationships in high-dimensional spaces and scale with large\ndatasets. This paper introduces a graph attention-based instance selection\n(GAIS) method that uses attention mechanisms to identify informative instances\nthrough their structural relationships in graph representations. We present two\napproaches for scalable graph construction: a distance-based mini-batch\nsampling technique that reduces computation through strategic batch processing,\nand a hierarchical hashing approach that allows for efficient similarity\ncomputation through random projections. The mini-batch approach keeps class\ndistributions through stratified sampling, while the hierarchical hashing\nmethod captures relationships at multiple granularities through single-level,\nmulti-level, and multi-view variants. Experiments across 39 datasets show that\nGAIS achieves reduction rates above 96\\% while maintaining or improving model\nperformance relative to state-of-the-art IS methods. The findings shows that\nthe distance-based mini-batch approach offers an optimal balance of efficiency\nand effectiveness for large-scale datasets, while multi-view variants provide\nsuperior performance for complex, high-dimensional data, demonstrating that\nattention-based importance scoring can effectively identify instances crucial\nfor maintaining decision boundaries without requiring exhaustive pairwise\ncomparisons.",

    "abstract":"Objective: To propose a CBCT dose optimization method using readily available\nmeasurement equipment in radiation oncology departments.\n  Approach: A 0.6cc air kerma (Kair) calibrated Farmer chamber measured Kair at\nisocenter for five default CBCT protocols (HEAD, PELVIS, LARGE PELVIS, THORAX,\nSPOTLIGHT) on a Varian TrueBeam linac. Imaging parameters were modified to\nreduce cumulative exposure by reducing projections (by 25%, 50%, 75%) in FDK\nreconstruction, or lowering single frame exposure by 25%, 50%, 70 to 75%. Cone\nBeam Dose Index (CBDI) and weighted CBDI (CBDI_w) were measured in CTDI\nphantoms to correlate with Kair. Image quality was assessed quantitatively (HU\nlinearity, uniformity, low-contrast visibility, high-contrast resolution,\nspatial integrity) using Catphan604, and qualitatively via anthropomorphic\nphantoms.\n  Results: A linear relationship between Kair, CTDI, and CBDI_w was\nestablished. High-contrast resolution and spatial integrity were unaffected by\ndose reduction (R < 0.5), while low-contrast visibility strongly correlated\nwith exposure (R > 0.75). HU uniformity and linearity remained stable (<40 HU\ndeviation), except for LARGE PELVIS at <50% single-frame exposure. 80 to 50%\ndose reduction retained clinically acceptable image quality with minimal\nartifacts or noise.\n  Significance: CBCT protocols on TrueBeam linacs were optimized for dose\nreduction. The method enables easy implementation by radiotherapy physicists\nwithout diagnostic physics equipment or expertise.",

    "abstract":"Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has shown notable potential in relieving the\nheavy demand of dense prediction tasks on large-scale well-annotated datasets,\nespecially for the challenging multi-organ segmentation (MoS). However, the\nprevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS caused by the substantial variations\nin organ size exacerbates the learning difficulty of the SSL network. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative semi-supervised\nnetwork with BAlanced Subclass regularIzation and semantic-Conflict penalty\nmechanism (BASIC) to effectively learn the unbiased knowledge for\nsemi-supervised MoS. Concretely, we construct a novel auxiliary subclass\nsegmentation (SCS) task based on priorly generated balanced subclasses, thus\ndeeply excavating the unbiased information for the main MoS task with the\nfashion of multi-task learning. Additionally, based on a mean teacher\nframework, we elaborately design a balanced subclass regularization to utilize\nthe teacher predictions of SCS task to supervise the student predictions of MoS\ntask, thus effectively transferring unbiased knowledge to the MoS subnetwork\nand alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem. Considering the\nsimilar semantic information inside the subclasses and their corresponding\noriginal classes (i.e., parent classes), we devise a semantic-conflict penalty\nmechanism to give heavier punishments to the conflicting SCS predictions with\nwrong parent classes and provide a more accurate constraint to the MoS\npredictions. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available\ndatasets, i.e., the WORD dataset and the MICCAI FLARE 2022 dataset, have\nverified the superior performance of our proposed BASIC compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract":"Galaxy clusters selected based on overdensities of galaxies in photometric\nsurveys provide the largest cluster samples. Yet modeling the selection\nfunction of such samples is complicated by non-cluster members projected along\nthe line of sight (projection effects) and the potential detection of\nunvirialized objects (contamination). We empirically constrain the magnitude of\nthese effects by cross-matching galaxy clusters selected in the Dark Energy\nsurvey data with the \\rdmpr$\\,$ algorithm with significant detections in three\nSouth Pole Telescope surveys (SZ, pol-ECS, pol-500d). For matched clusters, we\naugment the \\rdmpr$\\,$catalog by the SPT detection significance. For unmatched\nobjects we use the SPT detection threshold as an upper limit on the SZe\nsignature. Using a Bayesian population model applied to the collected\nmulti-wavelength data, we explore various physically motivated models to\ndescribe the relationship between observed richness and halo mass. Our analysis\nreveals the limitations of a simple lognormal scatter model in describing the\ndata. We rule out significant contamination by unvirialized objects at the\nhigh-richness end of the sample. While dedicated simulations offer a\nwell-fitting calibration of projection effects, our findings suggest the\npresence of redshift-dependent trends that these simulations may not have\ncaptured. Our findings highlight that modeling the selection function of\noptically detected clusters remains a complicated challenge, requiring a\ncombination of simulation and data-driven approaches.",

    "abstract":"Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by\npredicting human-understandable concepts as intermediates for decision-making.\nHowever, these models often face challenges in ensuring reliable concept\nrepresentations, which can propagate to downstream tasks and undermine\nrobustness, especially under distribution shifts. Two inherent issues\ncontribute to concept unreliability: sensitivity to concept-irrelevant features\n(e.g., background variations) and lack of semantic consistency for the same\nconcept across different samples. To address these limitations, we propose the\nReliability-Enhanced Concept Embedding Model (RECEM), which introduces a\ntwo-fold strategy: Concept-Level Disentanglement to separate irrelevant\nfeatures from concept-relevant information and a Concept Mixup mechanism to\nensure semantic alignment across samples. These mechanisms work together to\nimprove concept reliability, enabling the model to focus on meaningful object\nattributes and generate faithful concept representations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that RECEM consistently outperforms existing baselines across\nmultiple datasets, showing superior performance under background and domain\nshifts. These findings highlight the effectiveness of disentanglement and\nalignment strategies in enhancing both reliability and robustness in CBMs.",

    "abstract":"Gaussian Splatting (GS) has become one of the most important neural rendering\nalgorithms. GS represents 3D scenes using Gaussian components with trainable\ncolor and opacity. This representation achieves high-quality renderings with\nfast inference. Regrettably, it is challenging to integrate such a solution\nwith varying light conditions, including shadows and light reflections, manual\nadjustments, and a physical engine. Recently, a few approaches have appeared\nthat incorporate ray-tracing or mesh primitives into GS to address some of\nthese caveats. However, no such solution can simultaneously solve all the\nexisting limitations of the classical GS. Consequently, we introduce\nREdiSplats, which employs ray tracing and a mesh-based representation of flat\n3D Gaussians. In practice, we model the scene using flat Gaussian distributions\nparameterized by the mesh. We can leverage fast ray tracing and control\nGaussian modification by adjusting the mesh vertices. Moreover, REdiSplats\nallows modeling of light conditions, manual adjustments, and physical\nsimulation. Furthermore, we can render our models using 3D tools such as\nBlender or Nvdiffrast, which opens the possibility of integrating them with all\nexisting 3D graphics techniques dedicated to mesh representations.",

In this paper, we integrate theoretical insights on Africa's\nlanguage landscape with an empirical evaluation using Sahara - a comprehensive\nbenchmark curated from large-scale, publicly accessible datasets capturing the\ncontinent's linguistic diversity. By systematically assessing the performance\nof leading large language models (LLMs) on Sahara, we demonstrate how\npolicy-induced data variations directly impact model effectiveness across\nAfrican languages. Our findings reveal that while a few languages perform\nreasonably well, many Indigenous languages remain marginalized due to sparse\ndata.

Although existing methods can form satisfactory point clouds in\nglobal completeness, they often lose the original geometry details and face the\nproblem of geometric inconsistency between existing point clouds and\nreconstructed missing parts. To tackle this problem, we introduce\nSymmCompletion, a highly effective completion method based on symmetry\nguidance. Our method comprises two primary components: a Local Symmetry\nTransformation Network (LSTNet) and a Symmetry-Guidance Transformer (SGFormer).\nFirst, LSTNet efficiently estimates point-wise local symmetry transformation to\ntransform key geometries of partial inputs into missing regions, thereby\ngenerating geometry-align partial-missing pairs and initial point clouds.\nSecond, SGFormer leverages the geometric features of partial-missing pairs as\nthe explicit symmetric guidance that can constrain the refinement process for\ninitial point clouds. As a result, SGFormer can exploit provided priors to form\nhigh-fidelity and geometry-consistency final point clouds. Qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks.",

Most existing\napproaches in LiDAR place recognition dominantly focus on the spinning type\nLiDAR to exploit its large FOV for matching. However, with the recent emergence\nof various LiDAR types, the importance of matching data across different LiDAR\ntypes has grown significantly-a challenge that has been largely overlooked for\nmany years. To address these challenges, we introduce HeLiOS, a deep network\ntailored for heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition, which utilizes small local\nwindows with spherical transformers and optimal transport-based cluster\nassignment for robust global descriptors.

    "abstract":"Online boards offer a platform for sharing and discussing content, where\ndiscussion emerges as a cascade of comments in response to a post. Branching\npoint process models offer a practical approach to modelling these cascades;\nhowever, existing models do not account for apparent features of empirical\ndata. We address this gap by illustrating the flexibility of Hawkes processes\nto model data arising from this context as well as outlining the computational\ntools needed to service this class of models. For example, the distribution of\nreplies within discussions tends to have a heavy tail. As such, a small number\nof posts and comments may generate many replies, while most generate few or\nnone, similar to `superspreading' in epidemics. Here, we propose a novel model\nfor online discussion, motivated by a dataset arising from discussions on the\nr\/ireland subreddit, that accommodates such phenomena and develop a framework\nfor Bayesian inference that considers in- and out-of-sample tests for\ngoodness-of-fit. This analysis shows that discussions within this community\nfollow a circadian rhythm and are subject to moderate superspreading dynamics.\nFor example, we estimate that the expected discussion size is approximately\nfour for initial posts between 04:00 and 12:00 but approximately 2.5 from 15:00\nto 02:00. We also estimate that 58% to 62% of posts fail to generate any\ndiscussion, with 95% posterior probability. Thus, we demonstrate that our\nframework offers a general approach to modelling discussion on online boards.",

    "abstract":"The advent of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has advanced the\nvideo-based tasks, such as video captioning and video understanding. Some\nprevious research indicates that taking texts in videos as input can further\nimprove the performance of video understanding. As a type of indispensable\ninformation in short videos or movies, subtitles can assist LVLMs to better\nunderstand videos. Most existing methods for video subtitle extraction are\nbased on a multi-stage framework, handling each frame independently. They can\nhardly exploit the temporal information of videos. Although some LVLMs exhibit\nthe robust OCR capability, predicting accurate timestamps for subtitle texts is\nstill challenging. In this paper, we propose an End-to-end Video Subtitle\nExtraction method, called EVE, which consists of three modules: a vision\nencoder, an adapter module, and a large language model. To effectively compress\nthe visual tokens from the vision encoder, we propose a novel adapter\nInterleavedVT to interleave two modalities. It contains a visual compressor and\na textual region compressor. The proposed InterleavedVT exploits both the\nmerits of average pooling and Q-Former in token compression. Taking the\ntemporal information of videos into account, we introduce a sliding-window\nmechanism in the textual region compressor. To benchmark the video subtitle\nextraction task, we propose a large dataset ViSa including 2.5M videos.\nExtensive experiments on ViSa demonstrate that the proposed EVE can outperform\nexisting open-sourced tools and LVLMs.",

In practical scenarios like recommendations, as users\nincreasingly seek personalized experiences, it becomes crucial to incorporate\nuser interaction history into the context of LLMs to enhance personalization.\nHowever, from a practical utility perspective, user interactions' extensive\nlength and noise present challenges when used directly as text prompts. A\npromising solution is to compress and distill interactions into compact\nembeddings, serving as soft prompts to assist LLMs in generating personalized\nresponses. Although this approach brings efficiency, a critical concern\nemerges: Can user embeddings adequately capture valuable information and prompt\nLLMs? To address this concern, we propose \\name, a benchmark designed to\nevaluate the effectiveness of user embeddings in prompting LLMs for\npersonalization. We establish a fair and standardized evaluation process,\nencompassing pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation stages. To thoroughly\nevaluate user embeddings, we design three dimensions of tasks: sequence\nunderstanding, action prediction, and interest perception. These evaluation\ntasks cover the industry's demands in traditional recommendation tasks, such as\nimproving prediction accuracy, and its aspirations for LLM-based methods, such\nas accurately understanding user interests and enhancing the user experience.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art methods for\nmodeling user embeddings.

However, traditional text-trained or numeric\nsimilarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of\nfinancial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series\nforecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B\nlarge language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection\nmethod enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the\nsimilarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These\nadvancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns\nwhile effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support\nrobust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial\nindicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval\nmethods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an\n8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful\nsequences compared to existing retrieval methods.

Within a joint\nmodeling framework, this approach connects a latent variable, derived from\nHRQoL data, to cause-specific hazards of dropout. Unlike traditional joint\nmodels, which treat longitudinal data as a covariate in the survival submodel,\nour approach prioritizes the longitudinal data and incorporates the log\nbaseline dropout risks as covariates in the latent process. This leads to a\nmore accurate analysis of longitudinal data, accounting for potential effects\nof dropout risks. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that\nextJMIRT provides robust and unbiased parameter estimates and highlight the\nimportance of accounting for informative dropout. We also apply this\nmethodology to HRQoL data from patients with progressive glioblastoma,\nshowcasing its practical utility.",

    "abstract":"The organization of neurons into functionally related assemblies is a\nfundamental feature of cortical networks, yet our understanding of how these\nassemblies maintain distinct identities while sharing members remains limited.\nHere we analyze how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the\nformation and stability of overlapping neuronal assemblies in recurrently\ncoupled networks of spiking neuron models. Using numerical simulations and an\nassociated mean-field theory, we demonstrate that the temporal structure of the\nSTDP rule, specifically its degree of causality, critically determines whether\nassemblies that share neurons maintain segregation or merge together after\ntraining is completed. We find that causal STDP rules, where\npotentiation\/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede\/proceed\npostsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial\noverlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively\ncancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared\nneurons. In contrast, acausal STDP rules lead to assembly fusion when overlap\nexceeds a critical threshold, due to unchecked growth of common input\ncorrelations. Our results provide theoretical insight into how\nspike-timing-dependent learning rules can support distributed representation\nwhere individual neurons participate in multiple assemblies while maintaining\nfunctional specificity.",

    "abstract":"Quantum effects in metrology can in principle enhance measurement precision\nfrom the so-called standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg Limit. Further\nadvancements in quantum metrology largely rely on innovative metrology\nprotocols that can avoid a number of known obstacles, including the challenge\nof preparing entangled states with sufficient fidelity, the readout noise in\nmeasuring highly entangled states, and no-go theorems for quantum metrology\nunder noisy environments. In this Letter, exploiting some peculiar but\nexperimentally feasible dynamical features of a collection of spins with\nall-to-all time-periodic interactions, we propose a metrology protocol that can\ncircumvent all the three mentioned obstacles and yet still make good use of\ntime as a resource for metrology. Specifically, by mapping the dynamics of such\na periodically driven spin system to that of a paradigm of quantum chaos but\ntuned to some high-order quantum resonance, it is shown that a simple $SU(2)$\ncoherent state can, after evolving to highly entangled states in the ensuing\ndynamics, be dynamically brought back to the same initial coherent state. The\nassociated quantum Fisher information is found to exhibit quadratic scaling\nwith both the number of spins and the duration of the metrology protocol. The\nachieved Heisenberg scaling can also largely survive in the presence of\nMarkovian noise. Representing a previously unknown strategy for quantum\nmetrology, the protocol proposed here can be tested on available experimental\nplatforms.",

This\nquantum-corrected black hole can be interpreted as a modified Schwarzschild\nblack hole, where the Schwarzschild metric function is adjusted by an\nadditional term proportional to $\\frac{M^{2}}{r^{4}}$, with $r$ denoting the\nradial coordinate and $M,$ the black hole mass. In this study, we show that\nsuch a quantum-mechanically modified black hole can arise in the context of\nnonlinear electrodynamics with either electric or magnetic charge. This\ncharged, quantum-corrected solution is then matched to a dust ball of constant\nmass $M_{APS}$, governed by the APS metric, at a timelike thin-shell possessing\nnonzero mass $m$ and electric charge $Q$ or magnetic charge $P$. Analytically,\nit is demonstrated that the thin-shell oscillates around an equilibrium radius\n$r=R_{eq}$, which is expressed in terms of $% M_{APS}$, $m$, and $Q$ or $P$.",

    "abstract":"Quantum generative models may achieve an advantage on quantum devices by\ntheir inherent probabilistic nature and efficient sampling strategies. However,\ncurrent approaches mostly rely on general-purpose circuits, such as the\nhardware efficient ansatz paired with a random initialization strategy, which\nare known to suffer from trainability issues such as barren plateaus. To\naddress these issues, a tensor network pretraining framework that initializes a\nquantum circuit ansatz with a classically computed high-quality solution for a\nlinear entanglement structure has been proposed in literature. In order to\nimprove the classical solution, the quantum circuit needs to be extended, while\nit is still an open question how the extension affects trainability. In this\nwork, we propose the metric-based extension heuristic to design an extended\ncircuit based on a similarity metric measured between the dataset features. We\nvalidate this method on the bars and stripes dataset and carry out experiments\non financial data. Our results underline the importance of problem-informed\ncircuit design and show that the metric-based extension heuristic offers the\nmeans to introduce inductive bias while designing a circuit under limited\nresources.",

    "abstract":"Learning effective latent representations for users and items is the\ncornerstone of recommender systems. Traditional approaches rely on user-item\ninteraction data to map users and items into a shared latent space, but the\nsparsity of interactions often poses challenges. While leveraging user reviews\ncould mitigate this sparsity, existing review-aware recommendation models often\nexhibit two key limitations. First, they typically rely on reviews as\nadditional features, but reviews are not universal, with many users and items\nlacking them. Second, such approaches do not integrate reviews into the\nuser-item space, leading to potential divergence or inconsistency among user,\nitem, and review representations. To overcome these limitations, our work\nintroduces a Review-centric Contrastive Alignment Framework for Recommendation\n(ReCAFR), which incorporates reviews into the core learning process, ensuring\nalignment among user, item, and review representations within a unified space.\nSpecifically, we leverage two self-supervised contrastive strategies that not\nonly exploit review-based augmentation to alleviate sparsity, but also align\nthe tripartite representations to enhance robustness. Empirical studies on\npublic benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of\nReCAFR.",

One approach for determining\nhow to allocate a treatment in such settings is the resource-constrained\noptimal dynamic treatment rule (RC ODTR) SuperLearner algorithm, developed by\nLuedtke and van der Laan. In this paper, we describe this algorithm, offer\nvarious novel approaches for presenting the RC ODTR and its value in terms of\nbenefit and cost, and provide practical guidance on implementing the algorithm\n(including software). In particular, we apply this method to the Adaptive\nStrategies for Preventing and Treating Lapses of Retention in HIV care\n(NCT02338739) trial to determine how to best allocate conditional cash\ntransfers (CCTs) for increasing HIV care adherence given varying constraints on\nthe proportion of people who can receive CCTs in the population, providing one\nof the few applied illustrations of this method and novel substantive findings.\nWe find that there are clinical and monetary benefits to deploying CCTs to a\nsmall percent (e.g., 10\\%) of the population compared to administering the care\nstandard for all; however, results suggest that these incremental benefits are\nonly due to the loosening of constraints, rather than a presence of treatment\neffect heterogeneity strong enough to drive a more efficient and effective\nconstrained allocation approach.",

By using a logistic classifier to\ncalculate the probability of assignment between the control and experimental\ngroups a log odds value or 'logit' score is assigned to each data point.

While a viable inference technique, many implementations of PSM\nfail to properly outline the methodology used, such as not explaining feature\nselection and matching techniques. This paper outlines multiple different\ntechniques for both feature selection and matching which then are compared\nbased on their efficiency. Three unique quantitative feature selection methods\nwere utilized including random removal, feature importance calculation, and\nindividual removal. Individual removal was the most efficient in consolidating\nthe overlap between the treatment and control groups. The matching techniques\nused were bisect, binary insertion, nearest neighbors, and the most efficient,\nnearest neighbor with a caliper, in order to limit the error percentage and\nstandard mean deviation. Only testing these techniques on a data set that\nincluded patients treated with semaglutide makes it not possible to\ndefinitively state which technique is the best.

    "title":"Investigating Disc-Corona Interaction in Axisymmetric Accretion Disc\n  Models",
    "abstract":"The interaction between the accretion disc and its corona plays a critical\nrole in the energy balance and emission mechanisms in astrophysical systems\nsuch as active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. However, the detailed\nphysics of disc-corona interactions, including the mechanisms driving disc\nevaporation, and the impact of accretion rate and viscosity, remains poorly\nunderstood. Our study aims to extend the well-known disc evaporation model to\ninvestigate the disc-corona interaction in a 2D axisymmetric, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic model, focusing on the effects of viscosity, accretion rate, and\ntheir influence on disc evaporation, luminosity, and corona formation. We\ndevelop a hydrodynamic model consisting of a thin accretion disc, a corona, and\na vacuum region. Our model is implemented in \\textit{Athena++}, with the\ngas-vacuum interface tracking algorithm to handle the vacuum regions. We\nperform simulations incorporating turbulent viscosity, thermal conduction,\nBremsstrahlung cooling, and artificial disc cooling, starting from an adiabatic\nstate to explore the disc-corona interaction. We demonstrate the presence of\nacoustic shock heating, a mechanism widely studied in the solar physics\ncommunity but less explored in the context of accretion discs. We find that the\nviscosity dominates the intensity of disc evaporation, the accretion rate\nprimarily determines the disc truncation radius and the disc luminosity, and\nthere may be a positive correlation between the corona luminosity and the\nevaporation intensity. We also compare our results with the observations and\nsimulations, and estimate the $y$-parameters to explore the potential effects\nof Compton cooling.",

However, it faces significant computational\nchallenges in the era of large-scale data, particularly when dealing with\ntime-dependent covariates. This paper proposes a moment-assisted subsampling\nmethod that is both statistically and computationally efficient for inference\nunder the Cox model. This efficiency is achieved by integrating the\ncomputationally efficient uniform subsampling estimator and whole data sample\nmoments that are easy to compute even for large datasets. The resulting\nestimator is asymptotically normal with a smaller variance than the uniform\nsubsampling estimator. Additionally, we derive the optimal sample moment for\nthe Cox model that minimizes the asymptotic variance in Loewner order. With the\noptimal moment, the proposed estimator can achieve the same estimation\nefficiency as the whole data-based partial likelihood estimator while\nmaintaining the computational advantages of subsampling. Simulation studies and\nreal data analyses demonstrate the promising finite sample performance of the\nproposed estimator in terms of both estimation and computational efficiency.",

We prove that for MSD protocols based on CSS codes with\ntransversal non-Clifford gates, the first-order effect of imperfect measurement\nwill at most cause biased Pauli noise on the target states. Furthermore, we\nprove that we can minimize the effect of imperfect measurement noise on the\nasymptotically distilled states by measuring stabilizer generators in the\nstandard form. We numerically demonstrate our theoretical results by simulating\nthe $[[15, 1, 3]]$ and $[[14, 2, 2]]$ MSD protocols using the mapping from MSD\nprotocols to dynamical systems. Our numerical results imply that the existence\nof imperfect measurement degrades the order of convergence rate to linear,\nregardless of the original order in the noiseless case.

This integration has significantly\nenhanced performance across a diverse spectrum of applications, such as scene\nperception and robotics. However, the deployment of VLMs has also given rise to\ncritical safety and security concerns, necessitating extensive research to\nassess the potential vulnerabilities these VLM systems may harbor. In this\nwork, we present an in-depth survey of the attack strategies tailored for VLMs.\nWe categorize these attacks based on their underlying objectives - namely\njailbreak, camouflage, and exploitation - while also detailing the various\nmethodologies employed for data manipulation of VLMs. Meanwhile, we outline\ncorresponding defense mechanisms that have been proposed to mitigate these\nvulnerabilities. By discerning key connections and distinctions among the\ndiverse types of attacks, we propose a compelling taxonomy for VLM attacks.\nMoreover, we summarize the evaluation metrics that comprehensively describe the\ncharacteristics and impact of different attacks on VLMs. Finally, we conclude\nwith a discussion of promising future research directions that could further\nenhance the robustness and safety of VLMs, emphasizing the importance of\nongoing exploration in this critical area of study.

    "abstract":"To automatically detect Anterior Mediastinum Lesions (AMLs) in the Anterior\nMediastinum (AM), the primary requirement will be an automatic segmentation\nmodel specifically designed for the AM. The prevalence of AML is extremely low,\nmaking it challenging to conduct screening research similar to lung cancer\nscreening. Retrospectively reviewing chest CT scans over a specific period to\ninvestigate the prevalence of AML requires substantial time. Therefore,\ndeveloping an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to find location of AM helps\nradiologist to enhance their ability to manage workloads and improve diagnostic\naccuracy for AMLs. In this paper, we introduce a U-shaped structure network to\nsegment AM. Two attention mechanisms were used for maintaining long-range\ndependencies and localization. In order to have the potential of Multi-Head\nSelf-Attention (MHSA) and a lightweight network, we designed a parallel MHSA\nnamed Wide-MHSA (W-MHSA). Maintaining long-range dependencies is crucial for\nsegmentation when we upsample feature maps. Therefore, we designed a Dilated\nDepth-Wise Parallel Path connection (DDWPP) for this purpose. In order to\ndesign a lightweight architecture, we introduced an expanding convolution block\nand combine it with the proposed W-MHSA for feature extraction in the encoder\npart of the proposed U-shaped network. The proposed network was trained on 2775\nAM cases, which obtained an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of\n87.83%, mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 79.16%, and Sensitivity of\n89.60%. Our proposed architecture exhibited superior segmentation performance\ncompared to the most advanced segmentation networks, such as Trans Unet,\nAttention Unet, Res Unet, and Res Unet++.",

    "title":"BarcodeMamba: State Space Models for Biodiversity Analysis",
    "abstract":"DNA barcodes are crucial in biodiversity analysis for building automatic\nidentification systems that recognize known species and discover unseen\nspecies. Unlike human genome modeling, barcode-based invertebrate\nidentification poses challenges in the vast diversity of species and taxonomic\ncomplexity. Among Transformer-based foundation models, BarcodeBERT excelled in\nspecies-level identification of invertebrates, highlighting the effectiveness\nof self-supervised pretraining on barcode-specific datasets. Recently,\nstructured state space models (SSMs) have emerged, with a time complexity that\nscales sub-quadratically with the context length. SSMs provide an efficient\nparameterization of sequence modeling relative to attention-based\narchitectures. Given the success of Mamba and Mamba-2 in natural language, we\ndesigned BarcodeMamba, a performant and efficient foundation model for DNA\nbarcodes in biodiversity analysis. We conducted a comprehensive ablation study\non the impacts of self-supervised training and tokenization methods, and\ncompared both versions of Mamba layers in terms of expressiveness and their\ncapacity to identify \"unseen\" species held back from training. Our study shows\nthat BarcodeMamba has better performance than BarcodeBERT even when using only\n8.3% as many parameters, and improves accuracy to 99.2% on species-level\naccuracy in linear probing without fine-tuning for \"seen\" species. In our\nscaling study, BarcodeMamba with 63.6% of BarcodeBERT's parameters achieved\n70.2% genus-level accuracy in 1-nearest neighbor (1-NN) probing for unseen\nspecies. The code repository to reproduce our experiments is available at\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/bioscan-ml\/BarcodeMamba.",

    "abstract":"Despite the promising performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in\nbrain tumor diagnosis from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), their integration\ninto the clinical workflow has been limited. That is mainly due to the fact\nthat the features contributing to a model's prediction are unclear to\nradiologists and hence, clinically irrelevant, i.e., lack of explainability. As\nthe invaluable sources of radiologists' knowledge and expertise, radiology\nreports can be integrated with MRI in a contrastive learning (CL) framework,\nenabling learning from image-report associations, to improve CNN\nexplainability. In this work, we train a multimodal CL architecture on 3D brain\nMRI scans and radiology reports to learn informative MRI representations.\nFurthermore, we integrate tumor location, salient to several brain tumor\nanalysis tasks, into this framework to improve its generalizability. We then\napply the learnt image representations to improve explainability and\nperformance of genetic marker classification of pediatric Low-grade Glioma, the\nmost prevalent brain tumor in children, as a downstream task. Our results\nindicate a Dice score of 31.1% between the model's attention maps and manual\ntumor segmentation (as an explainability measure) with test classification\nperformance of 87.7%, significantly outperforming the baselines. These\nenhancements can build trust in our model among radiologists, facilitating its\nintegration into clinical practices for more efficient tumor diagnosis.",

While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process,\nthe focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role\nof animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on\noptimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the\nnnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most\nimportantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models,\nindicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice\nscans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images\nfor lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior\nstate-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and\ntumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung\ntumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation\nefforts.

This system enables earlier and more accurate identification of\nstudents at risk for ADHD, providing timely support to enhance their\ndevelopmental outcomes. This study showcases the potential of integrating EEG\nanalysis with DL to enhance ADHD diagnostics, presenting a viable alternative\nto traditional methods.",

Uncertainty estimates to identify DLM\npredictions at the cellular or single-pixel level that require clinician review\ncan enhance trust.

A novel approach to compute pixel-by-pixel uncertainty\nestimations of DLM segmentation performance in multiple clinical regions from a\nsingle dermoscopy image with corresponding Dice scores is reported for the\nfirst time. Image-level uncertainty maps demonstrated correspondence between\nimperfect DLM segmentation and high uncertainty levels in specific skin tissue\nregions, with or without lesions. Four new linear regression models that can\npredict the Dice performance of DLM segmentation using constants and\nuncertainty measures, either individually or in combination from lesions,\ntissue structures, and non-tissue pixel regions critical for clinical diagnosis\nand prognostication in skin images (Spearman's correlation, p < 0.05), are\nreported for the first time for low-compute uncertainty estimation workflows.",

By reconstructing individual neurons' morphology, we can gain valuable\ninsights into brain connectivity, revealing the structure basis of cognition,\nmovement, and perception. Despite the accumulation of extensive 3D microscopic\nimaging data, progress has been considerably hindered by the absence of\nautomated tools to streamline this process. Here we introduce NeuroFly, a\nvalidated framework for large-scale automatic single neuron reconstruction.\nThis framework breaks down the process into three distinct stages:\nsegmentation, connection, and proofreading. In the segmentation stage, we\nperform automatic segmentation followed by skeletonization to generate\nover-segmented neuronal fragments without branches. During the connection\nstage, we use a 3D image-based path following approach to extend each fragment\nand connect it with other fragments of the same neuron. Finally, human\nannotators are required only to proofread the few unresolved positions. The\nfirst two stages of our process are clearly defined computer vision problems,\nand we have trained robust baseline models to solve them. We validated\nNeuroFly's efficiency using in-house datasets that include a variety of\nchallenging scenarios, such as dense arborizations, weak axons, images with\ncontamination. We will release the datasets along with a suite of visualization\nand annotation tools for better reproducibility. Our goal is to foster\ncollaboration among researchers to address the neuron reconstruction challenge,\nultimately accelerating advancements in neuroscience research.

Therefore, early and accurate prediction of HIE-related neurocognitive\noutcomes using deep learning models is critical for improving clinical\ndecision-making, guiding treatment decisions and assessing novel therapies.\nHowever, a major challenge in developing deep learning models for this purpose\nis the scarcity of large, annotated HIE datasets. We have assembled the first\nand largest public dataset, however it contains only 156 cases with 2-year\nneurocognitive outcome labels. In contrast, we have collected 8,859 normal\nbrain black Magnetic Resonance Imagings (MRIs) with 0-97 years of age that are\navailable for brain age estimation using deep learning models. In this paper,\nwe introduce AGE2HIE to transfer knowledge learned by deep learning models from\nhealthy controls brain MRIs to a diseased cohort, from structural to diffusion\nMRIs, from regression of continuous age estimation to prediction of the binary\nneurocognitive outcomes, and from lifespan age (0-97 years) to infant (0-2\nweeks).

    "abstract":"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is extensively used in clinical\nand preclinical settings to study brain function, however, fMRI data is\ninherently noisy due to physiological processes, hardware, and external noise.\nDenoising is one of the main preprocessing steps in any fMRI analysis pipeline.\nThis process is challenging in preclinical data in comparison to clinical data\ndue to variations in brain geometry, image resolution, and low signal-to-noise\nratios. In this paper, we propose a structure-preserved algorithm based on a 3D\nWasserstein generative adversarial network with a 3D dense U-net based\ndiscriminator called, 3D U-WGAN. We apply a 4D data configuration to\neffectively denoise temporal and spatial information in analyzing preclinical\nfMRI data. GAN-based denoising methods often utilize a discriminator to\nidentify significant differences between denoised and noise-free images,\nfocusing on global or local features. To refine the fMRI denoising model, our\nmethod employs a 3D dense U-Net discriminator to learn both global and local\ndistinctions. To tackle potential over-smoothing, we introduce an adversarial\nloss and enhance perceptual similarity by measuring feature space distances.\nExperiments illustrate that 3D U-WGAN significantly improves image quality in\nresting-state and task preclinical fMRI data, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio\nwithout introducing excessive structural changes in existing methods. The\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods when applied to simulated\nand real data in a fMRI analysis pipeline.",

    "abstract":"Accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective\nMRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART) in head and neck cancer. However,\nmanual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming and\nprone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to\novercome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, our\nteam, $\\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy\n(pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volume\nsegmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinal\nGTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet with\ndeep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset of\npre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dice\nsimilarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to models\ntrained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-aware\nattention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate features\nlearned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slight\nimprovements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI with\npre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10\npre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 for\nprimary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1. For\nTask 2, the ensemble of 10 mid-RT segmentation models attained an average\nDSCagg of 0.733, with 0.607 for GTVp and 0.859 for GTVn, leading us to\n$\\textbf{achieve 1st place}$. In summary, we presented a collection of DL\nmodels that could facilitate GTV segmentation in MRgART, offering the potential\nto streamline radiation oncology workflows.

    "title":"Enhancing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation for Fibrosis via\n  Controllable Image Generation",
    "abstract":"Fibrotic Lung Disease (FLD) is a severe condition marked by lung stiffening\nand scarring, leading to respiratory decline. High-resolution computed\ntomography (HRCT) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring FLD; however,\nfibrosis appears as irregular, diffuse patterns with unclear boundaries,\nleading to high inter-observer variability and time-intensive manual\nannotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffSeg, a novel weakly\nsupervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) method that uses image-level\nannotations to generate pixel-level fibrosis segmentation, reducing the need\nfor fine-grained manual labeling. Additionally, our DiffSeg incorporates a\ndiffusion-based generative model to synthesize HRCT images with different\nlevels of fibrosis from healthy slices, enabling the generation of the\nfibrosis-injected slices and their paired fibrosis location. Experiments\nindicate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of pseudo masks\ngenerated by existing WSSS methods, greatly reducing the complexity of manual\nlabeling and enhancing the consistency of the generated masks.",

    "title":"An Explainable Attention Model for Cervical Precancer Risk\n  Classification using Colposcopic Images",
    "abstract":"Cervical cancer remains a major worldwide health issue, with early\nidentification and risk assessment playing critical roles in effective\npreventive interventions. This paper presents the Cervix-AID-Net model for\ncervical precancer risk classification. The study designs and evaluates the\nproposed Cervix-AID-Net model based on patients colposcopy images. The model\ncomprises a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and convolutional\nlayers that extract interpretable and representative features of colposcopic\nimages to distinguish high-risk and low-risk cervical precancer. In addition,\nthe proposed Cervix-AID-Net model integrates four explainable techniques,\nnamely gradient class activation maps, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic\nExplanations, CartoonX, and pixel rate distortion explanation based on output\nfeature maps and input features. The evaluation using holdout and ten-fold\ncross-validation techniques yielded a classification accuracy of 99.33\\% and\n99.81\\%. The analysis revealed that CartoonX provides meticulous explanations\nfor the decision of the Cervix-AID-Net model due to its ability to provide the\nrelevant piece-wise smooth part of the image. The effect of Gaussian noise and\nblur on the input shows that the performance remains unchanged up to Gaussian\nnoise of 3\\% and blur of 10\\%, while the performance reduces thereafter. A\ncomparison study of the proposed model's performance compared to other deep\nlearning approaches highlights the Cervix-AID-Net model's potential as a\nsupplemental tool for increasing the effectiveness of cervical precancer risk\nassessment. The proposed method, which incorporates the CBAM and explainable\nartificial integration, has the potential to influence cervical cancer\nprevention and early detection, improving patient outcomes and lowering the\nworldwide burden of this preventable disease.",

    "abstract":"Radiation therapy (RT) is essential in treating head and neck cancer (HNC),\nwith magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)-guided RT offering superior soft tissue\ncontrast and functional imaging. However, manual tumor segmentation is\ntime-consuming and complex, and therfore remains a challenge. In this study, we\npresent our solution as team TUMOR to the HNTS-MRG24 MICCAI Challenge which is\nfocused on automated segmentation of primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and\nmetastatic lymph node gross tumor volume (GTVn) in pre-RT and mid-RT MRI\nimages. We utilized the HNTS-MRG2024 dataset, which consists of 150 MRI scans\nfrom patients diagnosed with HNC, including original and registered pre-RT and\nmid-RT T2-weighted images with corresponding segmentation masks for GTVp and\nGTVn. We employed two state-of-the-art models in deep learning, nnUNet and\nMedNeXt. For Task 1, we pretrained models on pre-RT registered and mid-RT\nimages, followed by fine-tuning on original pre-RT images. For Task 2, we\ncombined registered pre-RT images, registered pre-RT segmentation masks, and\nmid-RT data as a multi-channel input for training. Our solution for Task 1\nachieved 1st place in the final test phase with an aggregated Dice Similarity\nCoefficient of 0.8254, and our solution for Task 2 ranked 8th with a score of\n0.7005.

    "title":"White-Box Diffusion Transformer for single-cell RNA-seq generation",
    "abstract":"As a powerful tool for characterizing cellular subpopulations and cellular\nheterogeneity, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology offers\nadvantages of high throughput and multidimensional analysis. However, the\nprocess of data acquisition is often constrained by high cost and limited\nsample availability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model\nbased on Diffusion model and White-Box transformer that aims to generate\nsynthetic and biologically plausible scRNA-seq data. Diffusion model\nprogressively introduce noise into the data and then recover the original data\nthrough a denoising process, a forward and reverse process that is particularly\nsuitable for generating complex data distributions. White-Box transformer is a\ndeep learning architecture that emphasizes mathematical interpretability. By\nminimizing the encoding rate of the data and maximizing the sparsity of the\nrepresentation, it not only reduces the computational burden, but also provides\nclear insight into underlying structure. Our White-Box Diffusion Transformer\ncombines the generative capabilities of Diffusion model with the mathematical\ninterpretability of White-Box transformer. Through experiments using six\ndifferent single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we visualize both generated and real\ndata using t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, as well as quantify\nsimilarity between generated and real data using various metrics to demonstrate\ncomparable performance of White-Box Diffusion Transformer and Diffusion\nTransformer in generating scRNA-seq data alongside significant improvements in\ntraining efficiency and resource utilization.
