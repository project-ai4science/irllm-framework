To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++.

  Interactions for Computer-Aided Diagnosis; Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
extraordinary comprehension capabilities with remarkable breakthroughs on
various vision-language tasks. However, the application of LLMs in generating
reliable medical diagnostic reports remains in the early stages. Currently,
medical LLMs typically feature a passive interaction model where doctors
respond to patient queries with little or no involvement in analyzing medical
images. In contrast, some ChatBots simply respond to predefined queries based
on visual inputs, lacking interactive dialogue or consideration of medical
history. As such, there is a gap between LLM-generated patient-ChatBot
interactions and those occurring in actual patient-doctor consultations. To
bridge this gap, we develop an LLM-based dialogue system, namely proactive

quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise

transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify

Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 ± 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66–0.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01–3.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person‐years life lost from among US men women.

has become a prominent tool for unsupervised anomaly detection. However, recent
research by Hariri, Kind, and Brunner, published in TKDE 2021, has revealed
issues with iForest. They identified the presence of axis-aligned ghost
clusters that can be misidentified as normal clusters, leading to biased
anomaly scores and inaccurate predictions. In response, they developed the
Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), which effectively solves these issues by
eliminating the ghost clusters introduced by iForest. This enhancement results
in improved consistency of anomaly scores and superior performance. We reveal a
previously overlooked problem in the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), showing
that it is vulnerable to ghost inter-clusters between normal clusters of data
points. In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Isolation Forest (RIF)
algorithm which effectively addresses both the axis-aligned ghost clusters
observed in iForest and the ghost inter-clusters seen in EIF. RIF accomplishes
this by randomly rotating the dataset (using random rotation matrices and QR
decomposition) before feeding it into the iForest construction, thereby
increasing dataset variation and eliminating ghost clusters. Our experiments

  for Rice Breeding with Small, Structured Datasets; Genotype-to-Phenotype (G2P) prediction plays a pivotal role in crop breeding,
enabling the identification of superior genotypes based on genomic data. Rice
(Oryza sativa), one of the most important staple crops, faces challenges in
improving yield and resilience due to the complex genetic architecture of
agronomic traits and the limited sample size in breeding datasets. Current G2P
prediction methods, such as GWAS and linear models, often fail to capture
complex non-linear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, leading to
suboptimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, population stratification and
overfitting are significant obstacles when models are applied to small datasets
with diverse genetic backgrounds. This study introduces the Learnable Group
Transform (LGT) method, which aims to overcome these challenges by combining
the advantages of traditional linear models with advanced machine learning
techniques. LGT utilizes a group-based transformation of genotype data to
capture spatial relationships and genetic structures across diverse rice
populations, offering flexibility to generalize even with limited data. Through
extensive experiments on the Rice529 dataset, a panel of 529 rice accessions,
LGT demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for multiple
agronomic traits, including yield and plant height, compared to
state-of-the-art baselines such as linear models and recent deep learning
approaches. Notably, LGT achieved an R^2 improvement of up to 15\% for yield
prediction, significantly reducing error and demonstrating its ability to
extract meaningful signals from high-dimensional, noisy genomic data. These
results highlight the potential of LGT as a powerful tool for genomic
prediction in rice breeding, offering a promising solution for accelerating the

correlated, the latter strategy may further reduce inference costs by letting
inexpensive models anticipate abstention decisions by expensive models, thereby
obviating the need to run the expensive models. We investigate the benefits of

question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source
domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs
from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies
leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual
descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to

align different feature distributions across domains, while generally

Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and

knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be
adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we
introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation

research, we highlight the predictive processes that underlie human and
artificial thought. In humans, complex neural mechanisms interpret sensory
information under uncertainty, sometimes filling in gaps and creating false
perceptions. This inference occurs hierarchically: higher cortical levels send
top-down predictions to lower-level regions, while mismatches (prediction
errors) propagate upward to refine the model. LLMs, in contrast, rely on

problem. Existing methods to mitigate covariate shift often require additional

we propose a simple yet effective method (DeCIL) to mitigate covariate shift by
incorporating a denoising mechanism that enhances the contraction properties of
the state transition mapping. Our approach involves training two neural
networks: a dynamics model ( f ) that predicts the next state from the current
state, and a joint state-action denoising policy network ( d ) that refines
this state prediction via denoising and outputs the corresponding action. We
provide theoretical analysis showing that the denoising network acts as a local
contraction mapping, reducing the error propagation of the state transition and
improving stability. Our method is straightforward to implement and can be
easily integrated with existing imitation learning frameworks without requiring
additional expert data or complex modifications to the training procedure.

large gaps between the best known upper and lower bounds for many important

often tailored to obtaining a logarithmic bound and essentially cannot be used

deterministic upper bounds are often polylogarithmic, raising the fundamental
question of how to resolve the gap between logarithmic lower and

the attention gap. This attention gap widens with more severe distribution
shifts, hindering effective modality fusion. To mitigate this attention gap and
encourage better modality fusion, we propose attention bootstrapping that
promotes cross-attention with the guidance of self-attention. Moreover, to
reduce the gradient noise in the commonly-used entropy minimization, we adopt
principal entropy minimization, a refinement of entropy minimization that
reduces gradient noise by focusing on the principal parts of entropy, excluding
less reliable gradient information. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks

  Dyscoordination After Suprasacral Spinal Cord Injury by Proteomics; Objectives This study aimed to elucidate the potential mechanisms of
electroacupuncture (EA) in restoring detrusor-bladder neck dyssynergesia (DBND)
following suprasacral spinal cord injury.
  Methods A total of 52 adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned
to either a sham group (n=12) or a spinal cord injury model group (n=40). In
the model group, DBND was induced in 40 rats through Hassan Shaker spinal cord
transection, with 24 rats surviving spinal shock and subsequently randomized
into two groups: a model-only group (DBND, n=12) and an EA intervention group
(DBND+EA, n=12). DBND+EA was administered at Ciliao (BL32), Zhongji (RN3), and
Sanyinjiao (SP6) acupoints, for 20 minutes per session, once daily for 10
consecutive days. On day 29 post-injury, all rats underwent urodynamic
assessments, followed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, tandem mass tag

neck tissues.
  Results Urodynamic evaluation demonstrated that EA intervention enhanced
bladder function in DBND rats. HE staining indicated reduced fibroplasia in the
detrusor muscle and alleviated inflammation in the bladder neck following EA.
TMT proteomic analysis revealed 30 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in
the detrusor and 59 DEPs in the bladder neck post-EA treatment. WB results
corroborated these TMT findings.
  Conclusion EA effectively promotes synergy between the detrusor muscle and
