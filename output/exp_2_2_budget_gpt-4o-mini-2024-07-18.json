    "b_abstract":" Screening for lung cancer: 2023 guideline update from the American Cancer Society; Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of nodular lesions in the anterior mediastinum that had been found incidentally on screening chest computed tomography (CT) in asymptomatic subjects. Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women.

    "c_abstract":" Automated detection of anterior mediastinal nodular lesions (AMLs) has significance for clinical usage as it is challenging for radiologists to accurately identify AMLs from chest computed tomography (CT) imaging due to various factors, including poor resolution, variations in intensity and the similarity of the AMLs to other tissues. To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++. The proposed network employing attention mechanisms exhibited a promising result for segmenting AMLs from chest CT imaging and could be used to automate the AML detection process for achieving improved diagnostic reliability.",

    "c_abstract":" Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax\nplanning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language,\nwherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale\ndomains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render\nhuman annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting\nthe need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since\nrelevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these\nagents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a\nconversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of\nquestions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate\nthis task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user\neligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through\ninteractive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models\nstruggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a\nReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel\napproach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by\nmapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in\nstructured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves\nthe F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.",

Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women.

    "c_abstract":" Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nextraordinary comprehension capabilities with remarkable breakthroughs on\nvarious vision-language tasks. However, the application of LLMs in generating\nreliable medical diagnostic reports remains in the early stages. Currently,\nmedical LLMs typically feature a passive interaction model where doctors\nrespond to patient queries with little or no involvement in analyzing medical\nimages. In contrast, some ChatBots simply respond to predefined queries based\non visual inputs, lacking interactive dialogue or consideration of medical\nhistory. As such, there is a gap between LLM-generated patient-ChatBot\ninteractions and those occurring in actual patient-doctor consultations. To\nbridge this gap, we develop an LLM-based dialogue system, namely proactive\nmulti-round vision-language interactions for computer-aided diagnosis\n(ProMRVL-CAD), to generate patient-friendly disease diagnostic reports. The\nproposed ProMRVL-CAD system allows proactive dialogue to provide patients with\nconstant and reliable medical access via an integration of knowledge graph into\na recommendation system. Specifically, we devise two generators: a Proactive\nQuestion Generator (Pro-Q Gen) to generate proactive questions that guide the\ndiagnostic procedure and a Multi-Vision Patient-Text Diagnostic Report\nGenerator (MVP-DR Gen) to produce high-quality diagnostic reports. Evaluating\ntwo real-world publicly available datasets, MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray, our model\nhas better quality in generating medical reports. We further demonstrate the\nperformance of ProMRVL achieves robust under the scenarios with low image\nquality. Moreover, we have created a synthetic medical dialogue dataset that\nsimulates proactive diagnostic interactions between patients and doctors,\nserving as a valuable resource for training LLM.",

There is also a lack of\nstatistical grounding enabling sensitisation of risk models in the presence of\nabsence of AI to estimate causal contributions of AI. This is in part due to\nthe dearth of AI impact data upon which to fit distributions. In this work, we\naddress these gaps in two ways. First, we demonstrate how scenario modelling\n(grounded in established statistical techniques such as Markov chains, copulas\nand Monte Carlo simulation) can be used to model AI risk holistically. Second,\nwe show how lookalike distributions from phenomena analogous to AI can be used\nto estimate AI impacts in the absence of directly observable data.
