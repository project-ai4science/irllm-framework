    "b_abstract":" Establishing detailed relationships between transnormal systems of different\ntypes and their behaviors under covering maps, this paper presents a\nclassification of transnormal systems on compact 3-manifolds in the sense of\nequivalence. For CPC transnormal systems, we show that the ambient manifolds\nmust be locally isometric to one of six standard geometries up to equivalence.\nWe also find some equivalence classes containing no CPC transnormal system,\nhighlighting a critical distinction between isoparametric foliations and CPC\ntransnormal systems, which has not been previously addressed in the literature.",

    "c_abstract":" Detecting the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in particulate pipe\nsystems remains a complex issue in fluid dynamics, often requiring\nsophisticated and costly experimental apparatus. This research presents an\ninnovative streak visualization method designed to offer a simple and robust\napproach to identify transitional turbulent patterns in particulate pipe flows\nwith neutrally buoyant particles. The technique employs a laser arrangement and\na low-cost camera setup to capture particle-generated streaks within the fluid,\nenabling real-time observation of flow patterns. Validation of the proposed\nmethod was conducted through comparison with established techniques like\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and pressure drop measurements, confirming its\naccuracy and reliability. Experiments demonstrate the streak visualization\nmethod's capacity to differentiate between laminar, transitional, and turbulent\nflow regimes by analyzing the standard deviation of streak angles. The method\nis especially efficient at low particle concentration, ie precisely where other\nmore established methods become less effective. Furthermore, this technique\nenables us to identify a critical Reynolds number using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence built on the statistical distribution of streak angles, which is\nconsistent with previous studies.\n  Because it is effective at low concentrations and robust, this streak\nvisualization technique opens new perspectives for the characterization of\nparticulate pipe flows not only in the confines of the laboratory but also in\nless controlled industrial multi-phase flows where determining the laminar or\nturbulent nature of the flow is a prerequisite for flowmeter calibration.",

Although modern data processing systems embrace\nserverless storage, such as Amazon S3, they continue to manage their compute\nresources as servers. This is challenging for unpredictable workloads, leaving\nclusters often underutilized. Recent research shows the potential of serverless\ncompute resources, such as cloud functions, for elastic data processing, but\nalso sees limitations in performance robustness and cost efficiency for long\nrunning workloads. These challenges require holistic approaches across the\nsystem stack. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no end-to-end\ndata processing system built entirely on serverless infrastructure. In this\npaper, we present Skyrise, our effort towards building the first fully\nserverless SQL query processor. Skyrise exploits the elasticity of its\nunderlying infrastructure, while alleviating the inherent limitations with a\nnumber of adaptive and cost-aware techniques. We show that both Skyrise's\nperformance and cost are competitive to other cloud data systems for\nterabyte-scale queries of the analytical TPC-H benchmark.",

They found that when\nthe line force significantly weakens due to ionization, the winds are variable,\nwith a characteristic frequency comparable to the Lamb cut-off frequency of a\nstratified atmosphere, {\\omega}c. In this work, we present a set of simulations\nand perturbation analyses that elucidate the variability source and\ncharacteristics. We found that the line force adds wave energy and amplifies\nperturbations with frequencies near {\\omega}c. This selective amplification\nresults from the coupling between the natural tendency of velocity\nperturbations to grow in a stratified atmosphere and the dependence of the line\nforce on the velocity gradient, per the Castor-Abbott-Klein line-driven wind\ntheory. We also found that the variability stems from self-excitation that\noccurs in the exponential atmosphere due to the non-linearity introduced by the\nabsolute value of the velocity gradient in the line force prescription. We\nconclude that self-consistently calculating ionization is insufficient for\nmodeling the dynamics in the subsonic atmosphere. Instead future wind models\nshould relax the Sobolev approximation, or model the radiative transfer to\ncapture the dynamics and instabilities at the base of the wind.",

We restrict\nourselves to dimension $2$, and give particular attention to the question of\nlog-integrability of those angles. In the setting of random i.i.d.\\ products of\nmatrices, we construct examples of probability measures on \\(\\GL_2(\\R)\\) with\nfinite first moment, for which the angle between Oseledets directions of the\nassociated cocycle is not log-integrable. Building on work for the totally\nirreducible case by Benoist and Quint, we show that for probability measures\nwith finite second moment the angle between Oseledets subspaces is always\nlog-integrable. Then we pivot to general measurable \\(\\GL_2(\\R)\\)-cocycles over\nan arbitrary ergodic automorphism of a non-atomic Lebesgue space. We show that\nno integrability condition on the distribution of the matrices is sufficient to\nguarantee log-integrability of the angle between Oseledets spaces. In fact, in\nthis context we show that the joint distribution of the Oseledets spaces may be\nchosen arbitrarily. We also obtain a similar flexibility result for bounded\ncocycles under the proper condition on the distribution of angles.",

We demonstrate that microwave\nshielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of\ndifferent molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units\nof length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic\nscattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule\nbound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise\nat very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are\nnear-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the\nmolecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically\npolarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields.
