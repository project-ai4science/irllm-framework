2503.02738,"Variable-Friction In-Hand Manipulation for Arbitrary Objects via
  Diffusion-Based Imitation Learning","Dexterous in-hand manipulation (IHM) for arbitrary objects is challenging due
to the rich and subtle contact process. Variable-friction manipulation is an
alternative approach to dexterity, previously demonstrating robust and
versatile 2D IHM capabilities with only two single-joint fingers. However, the
hard-coded manipulation methods for variable friction hands are restricted to
regular polygon objects and limited target poses, as well as requiring the
policy to be tailored for each object. This paper proposes an end-to-end
learning-based manipulation method to achieve arbitrary object manipulation for
any target pose on real hardware, with minimal engineering efforts and data
collection. The method features a diffusion policy-based imitation learning
method with co-training from simulation and a small amount of real-world data.
With the proposed framework, arbitrary objects including polygons and
non-polygons can be precisely manipulated to reach arbitrary goal poses within
2 hours of training on an A100 GPU and only 1 hour of real-world data
collection. The precision is higher than previous customized object-specific
policies, achieving an average success rate of 71.3% with average pose error
being 2.676 mm and 1.902 degrees.",['cs.RO'],"['Yan Qiyang', 'Ding Zihan', 'Zhou Xin', 'Spiers Adam J.']",2025-03-04,,False
2502.16086,"Stealing Training Data from Large Language Models in Decentralized
  Training through Activation Inversion Attack","Decentralized training has become a resource-efficient framework to
democratize the training of large language models (LLMs). However, the privacy
risks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential
inclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper
identifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from
training data in decentralized training, and proposes \textit{activation
inversion attack} (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow
dataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public
datasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to
reconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized
training. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly
available datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training
to AIA. These findings highlight the urgent need to enhance security measures
in decentralized training to mitigate privacy risks in training LLMs.",['cs.CR'],"['Dai Chenxi', 'Lu Lin', 'Zhou Pan']",2025-02-22,,False

2501.1819,"Economic Rationality under Specialization: Evidence of Decision Bias in
  AI Agents","In the study by Chen et al. (2023) [01], the large language model GPT
demonstrated economic rationality comparable to or exceeding the average human
level in tasks such as budget allocation and risk preference. Building on this
finding, this paper further incorporates specialized agents, such as
biotechnology experts and economists, for a horizontal comparison to explore
whether specialization can enhance or maintain economic rationality equivalent
to that of GPT in similar decision-making scenarios. The results indicate that
when agents invest more effort in specialized fields, their decision-making
behavior is more prone to 'rationality shift,' specifically manifested as
increased violations of GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference),
decreased CCEI (Critical Cost Efficiency Index), and more significant decision
deviations under high-risk conditions. In contrast, GPT and more generalized
basic agents maintain a more stable and consistent level of rationality across
multiple tasks. This study reveals the inherent conflict between specialization
and economic rationality, providing new insights for constructing AI
decision-making systems that balance specialization and generalization across
various scenarios.",['cs.AI'],['Wen ShuiDe'],2025-01-30,,False
2501.18564,"SAM2Act: Integrating Visual Foundation Model with A Memory Architecture
  for Robotic Manipulation","Robotic manipulation systems operating in diverse, dynamic environments must
exhibit three critical abilities: multitask interaction, generalization to
unseen scenarios, and spatial memory. While significant progress has been made
in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization
to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To
bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based
policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations
from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average
success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and
demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3%
performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this
foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2,
which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to
enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent
tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial
memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive
performance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and
pushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems. Project page:

  1d quintic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation","We consider the 1d quintic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLS) on the
torus with initial data distributed according to the Gaussian measures with
covariance operator $(1-\Delta)^{-s}$, and denoted $\mu_s$. For the full range
$s>\frac{9}{10}$, we prove that these Gaussian measures are quasi-invariant
along the flow of (NLS), meaning that the law of the solution at any time is
absolutely continuous with respect to the initial Gaussian measure. Moreover,
the condition $s>\frac{9}{10}$ corresponds to the threshold where the Sobolev
space $H^{\frac{2}{5}+}(\mathbb{T})$ is of $\mu_s$-full measure (it is of zero
$\mu_s$-measure otherwise). This is the lower regularity Sobolev space where we
currently know that (NLS) is globally well-posed, thanks to a work by LI-WU-XU.
The present work extends the known threshold $s>\frac{3}{2}$ for the
quasi-invariance down to $s>\frac{9}{10}$, but we do not obtain here
quantitative results on the Radon-Nikodym derivatives. Our approach is based on
a work of Sun-Tzvetkov, combining a Poincar\'e-Dulac normal form reduction with

morphology, consisting of an initial impulsive phase followed by a gradual late
phase. Analyzing this specific morphology can uncover the underlying physics of
stellar flare dynamics, particularly the plasma
heating-evaporation-condensation process. While previous studies have mainly
examined peak-bump occurrences on M-dwarfs, this report extends the
investigation to G-, K-, and M-type stars. We utilize the flare catalog
published by arXiv:2212.00993, encompassing 12,597 flares, detected by using
$\textit{Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite}$ (TESS) observations. Our
analysis identifies 10,142 flares with discernible classical and complex
morphology, of which 197 ($\sim1.9\%$) exhibit the peak-bump feature. We delve
into the statistical properties of these TESS late-phase flares, noting that
both the amplitude and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration of both the
peaks and bumps show positive correlations across all source-star spectral
types, following a power law with indices 0.69 $\pm$ 0.09 and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.15,
respectively. Additionally, a negative correlation between flare amplitude and
the effective temperature of their host stars is observed. Compared to the
other flares in our sample, peak-bump flares tend to have larger and longer

2503.02619,XFMamba: Cross-Fusion Mamba for Multi-View Medical Image Classification,"Compared to single view medical image classification, using multiple views
can significantly enhance predictive accuracy as it can account for the
complementarity of each view while leveraging correlations between views.
Existing multi-view approaches typically employ separate convolutional or
transformer branches combined with simplistic feature fusion strategies.
However, these approaches inadvertently disregard essential cross-view
correlations, leading to suboptimal classification performance, and suffer from
challenges with limited receptive field (CNNs) or quadratic computational
complexity (transformers). Inspired by state space sequence models, we propose
XFMamba, a pure Mamba-based cross-fusion architecture to address the challenge
of multi-view medical image classification. XFMamba introduces a novel
two-stage fusion strategy, facilitating the learning of single-view features
and their cross-view disparity. This mechanism captures spatially long-range
dependencies in each view while enhancing seamless information transfer between
views. Results on three public datasets, MURA, CheXpert and DDSM, illustrate

Their performance is benchmarked on a dataset of CPU utilization measurements

release in the solar atmosphere, which can be accompanied by dynamic mass
motions and waves in the surrounding atmosphere. Here, we present observations
of plasma moving in a helical trajectory along a set of coronal loops formed

Assembly (AIA) instrument to track the helical motion of plasma and to
characterize its speed, acceleration, and physical properties. Additionally, we
explore the evolution of the plasma density and temperature along the helical
structure using the differential emission measure technique. The helical
structure was visible in AIA for approximately 22 minutes, having a diameter of
22 Mm, and a total trajectory of nearly 184 Mm. Analysis of the AIA

extremely soft gamma-ray burst (GRB) discovered on August 1, 2024 by the
Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, with a weak contemporaneous signal also detected
by Fermi/GBM. Optical spectroscopy of the afterglow, obtained by GTC and Keck,
identified the redshift of $z = 1.6734$. EP240801a exhibits a burst duration of
148 s in X-rays and 22.3 s in gamma-rays, with X-rays leading by 80.61 s.
Spectral lag analysis indicates the gamma-ray signal arrived 8.3 s earlier than
the X-rays. Joint spectral fitting of EP/WXT and Fermi/GBM data yields an
isotropic energy $E_{\gamma,\rm{iso}} = (5.57^{+0.54}_{-0.50})\times

S(25-50\,\rm{keV})/S(50-100\,\rm{keV}) = 1.67^{+0.74}_{-0.46}$, classifying
EP240801a as an X-ray flash (XRF). The host-galaxy continuum spectrum, inferred
using Prospector, was used to correct its contribution for the observed
outburst optical data. Unusual early $R$-band behavior and EP/FXT observations
suggest multiple components in the afterglow. Three models are considered:
two-component jet model, forward-reverse shock model and forward-shock model

two-component jet model and the energy injection model imply a relatively small
initial energy and velocity of the jet in the line of sight, while the
forward-reverse shock model remains typical. Under the two-component jet model,
EP240801a may resemble GRB 221009A (BOAT) if the bright narrow beam is viewed

  and Echo Planar Imaging","Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is widely used for its rapid acquisition but
suffers from severe geometric distortions due to B0 inhomogeneities,
particularly along the phase encoding direction. Existing methods follow a
two-step process: reconstructing blip-up/down EPI images, then estimating B0,
which can introduce error accumulation and reduce correction accuracy. This is
especially problematic in high B0 regions, where distortions align along the

reconstruct distortion-free images from rotated-view EPI acquisitions. INRs
offer a flexible, continuous representation that inherently captures complex

leveraging this property, our method dynamically adapts to subject-specific B0

fast direct-electron cameras with high dynamic ranges used for four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM). The availability of open
software packages is making such analyses widely accessible, and especially

atomic phase shifts from convergent-beam electron diffraction maps of pristine
monolayer graphene, which is an ideal dose-robust uniform phase object,

their computational efficiency and tolerance to reciprocal-space binning and
real-space thinning of the data. The quality of the phase images is assessed by
quantifying the variation of atomic phase shifts using a robust parameter-based
method revealing an overall agreement with some notable differences in the
absolute magnitudes and the variation of the phases. Although such variation is
not a major issue when analyzing data with many identical atoms, it does put
limits on what level of precision can be relied upon for unique sites such as
defects or dopants, which also tend to be more dose-sensitive. Overall, these

  Models through Self-Reflection","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit various biases and

investigated bias in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit
bias, leaving the more nuanced implicit biases largely unexplored. This paper
presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to
investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs. We propose a
novel ""self-reflection"" based evaluation framework that operates in two phases:
first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment
methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own
generated content. Through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a
substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases, where explicit
biases manifest as mild stereotypes while implicit biases show strong
stereotypes. Furthermore, we investigate the underlying factors contributing to
this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency. Our experiments examine the effects
of training data scale, model parameters, and alignment techniques. Results
indicate that while explicit bias diminishes with increased training data and
model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend. Notably,
contemporary alignment methods (e.g., RLHF, DPO) effectively suppress explicit

  Wireless Sensor Networks","This work aspires to provide a trustworthy solution for target localization
in adverse environments, where malicious nodes, capable of manipulating
distance measurements (i.e., performing spoofing attacks), are present, thus
hindering accurate localization. Besides localization, its other goal is to
identify (detect) which of the nodes participating in the process are
malicious. This problem becomes extremely important with the forthcoming
expansion of IoT and smart cities applications, that depend on accurate
localization, and the presence of malicious attackers can represent serious
security threats if not taken into consideration. This is the case with most
existing localization systems which makes them highly vulnerable to spoofing
attacks. In addition, existing methods that are intended for adversarial
settings consider very specific settings or require additional knowledge about
the system model, making them only partially secure. Therefore, this work
proposes a novel voting scheme based on clustering and weighted central mass to
securely solve the localization problem and detect attackers. The proposed
solution has two main phases: 1) Choosing a cluster of suitable points of
interest by taking advantage of the problem geometry to assigning votes in
order to localize the target, and 2) Attacker detection by exploiting the
location estimate and basic statistics. The proposed method is assessed in

self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
extracting meaningful representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
existing methods still struggle to adapt to the non-stationary, non-IID nature

Recent works have adopted a repeated cosine annealing schedule for large-scale
continual pre-training; however, these schedules (1) inherently cause
forgetting during the re-warming phase and (2) have not been systematically
compared to existing continual SSL methods. In this work, we systematically
compare the widely used cosine schedule with the recently proposed infinite
learning rate schedule and empirically find the latter to be a more effective
alternative. Our extensive empirical evaluation across diverse image and
language datasets demonstrates that the infinite learning rate schedule
consistently enhances continual pre-training performance compared to a repeated
cosine decay without being restricted to a fixed iteration budget. For
instance, in a small-scale MAE pre-training setup, it outperforms several
strong baselines from the literature. We then scale up our experiments to

  Reconstruction","DUSt3R has recently shown that one can reduce many tasks in multi-view
geometry, including estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics, reconstructing
the scene in 3D, and establishing image correspondences, to the prediction of a
pair of viewpoint-invariant point maps, i.e., pixel-aligned point clouds
defined in a common reference frame. This formulation is elegant and powerful,
but unable to tackle dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce
the concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), extending standard point maps to
support 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object
tracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key intuition is that, when time is
introduced, there are several possible spatial and time references that can be
used to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of such
combinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the sub tasks
mentioned above. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real

  Search","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
potential in automating machine learning tasks. However, existing LLM-based
agents often struggle with low-diversity and suboptimal code generation. While
recent work has introduced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to address these
issues, limitations persist in the quality and diversity of thoughts generated,
as well as in the scalar value feedback mechanisms used for node selection. In
this study, we introduce Introspective Monte Carlo Tree Search (I-MCTS), a
novel approach that iteratively expands tree nodes through an introspective
process that meticulously analyzes solutions and results from parent and
sibling nodes. This facilitates a continuous refinement of the node in the
search tree, thereby enhancing the overall decision-making process.
Furthermore, we integrate a Large Language Model (LLM)-based value model to
facilitate direct evaluation of each node's solution prior to conducting
comprehensive computational rollouts. A hybrid rewarding mechanism is
implemented to seamlessly transition the Q-value from LLM-estimated scores to
actual performance scores. This allows higher-quality nodes to be traversed
earlier. Applied to the various ML tasks, our approach demonstrates a 6%
absolute improvement in performance compared to the strong open-source AutoML
agents, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing agentic AutoML systems.

closed-packed systems simplified to one-dimensional strings and demonstrate how
Assembly can track the phase transformation. We then compare the Assembly of

We theoretically analyze the impact of the cutting point selection on the
convergence rate of the proposed framework, revealing that model splitting with

critical coupling, greater than the value $g_Y^f\approx 7$ at the ultraviolet

  Methods. We constructed gravitational potentials using optical and H I
rotation curve data, using stellar, gaseous, and dark matter components. We
explored a wide parameter space to see if the candidate progenitors of the
stellar streams could have originated from past interactions, testing both NFW

dumbbell-shaped quad-vortex mode where vortices detach from but remain
symmetric about the stagnation point. The numerical framework, representing the
first successful extension of TRT-RLB method to power-law fluid dynamics,
enables comprehensive mapping of flow characteristics across Reynolds numbers

pathways depending on the power-law index: at relatively small $n$, the flow
undergoes a direct supercritical bifurcation to simple extensional flow, while
at relatively large $n$, it evolves through an intermediate dumbbell-shaped
state. Among geometric parameters, the roller radius $r$ emerges as the
dominant factor controlling bifurcation points and vortex dimensions, whereas
the roller-container gap $\delta$ exerts minimal influence on flow regimes. The
transitions between flow modes can be precisely characterized through the

characteristics of AGN emission regions. We especially focus on the violated
relative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative
strengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We
investigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV
FeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into
two large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities
are in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent
(FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than
theoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII
model, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted
independently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that

correlations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of
FeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the
Eddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that
both ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines,
which is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical
FeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the
FeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an

it hard to balance the tradeoff between safety and other objectives. Human risk
preference has also rarely been incorporated, and the trained policy might be
either conservative or aggressive for users. To this end, this study proposes a
human-aligned safe RL approach for autonomous merging, in which the high-level
decision problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP)
that incorporates users' risk preference into the safety constraints, followed
by a model predictive control (MPC)-based low-level control. The safety level
of RL policy can be adjusted by computing cost limits of CMDP's constraints
based on risk preferences and traffic density using a fuzzy control method. To
filter out unsafe or invalid actions, we design an action shielding mechanism
that pre-executes RL actions using an MPC method and performs collision checks
with surrounding agents. We also provide theoretical proof to validate the
effectiveness of the shielding mechanism in enhancing RL's safety and sample

that our method can significantly reduce safety violations without sacrificing
traffic efficiency. Furthermore, due to the use of risk preference-aware

select unplayed vertices in a graph $G$ such that Dominator selects $a$ and
Staller selects $b$ vertices per move. Dominator wins if the vertices he
selected during the game form a dominating set of $G$, while Staller wins if
she can prevent Dominator from achieving this goal. Given a positive integer
$b$, Dominator's threshold, $\textrm{a}_b$, is the minimum $a$ such that
Dominator wins the $(a,b)$-biased game on $G$ when he starts the game.
Similarly, $\textrm{a}'_b$ denotes the minimum $a$ such that Dominator wins
when Staller starts the $(a,b)$-biased game. Staller's thresholds,
$\textrm{b}_a$ and $\textrm{b}'_a$, are defined analogously. It is proved that
Staller wins the $(k-1,k)$-biased games in a graph $G$ if its order is
sufficiently large with respect to a function of $k$ and the maximum degree of
$G$. Along the way, the $\ell$-local domination number of a graph is

  We show that when fairness is imposed on player 1, these games fall within

as a geometric phenomenon. The gravitational redshift, a classic test of GR,
can potentially be violated in alternative gravity theories, and experimental
tests on this effect are crucial for our understanding of gravity. In this
paper, considering the space-ground clock comparisons with free-space links, we
discuss a high-precision Doppler cancellation-based measurement model for
testing gravitational redshift. This model can effectively reduce various
sources of error and noise, reducing the influences of the first-order Doppler

  Automated Recall Assessments","Understanding how individuals perceive and recall information in their
natural environments is critical to understanding potential failures in
perception (e.g., sensory loss) and memory (e.g., dementia). Event
segmentation, the process of identifying distinct events within dynamic
environments, is central to how we perceive, encode, and recall experiences.
This cognitive process not only influences moment-to-moment comprehension but
also shapes event specific memory. Despite the importance of event segmentation
and event memory, current research methodologies rely heavily on human
judgements for assessing segmentation patterns and recall ability, which are
subjective and time-consuming. A few approaches have been introduced to
automate event segmentation and recall scoring, but validity with human
responses and ease of implementation require further advancements. To address
these concerns, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate event
segmentation and assess recall, employing chat completion and text-embedding
models, respectively. We validated these models against human annotations and
determined that LLMs can accurately identify event boundaries, and that human
event segmentation is more consistent with LLMs than among humans themselves.
Using this framework, we advanced an automated approach for recall assessments
which revealed semantic similarity between segmented narrative events and
participant recall can estimate recall performance. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can effectively simulate human segmentation patterns and provide

brightness sources in our new high-frequency observations (0.3-2 GHz) and
classify them as radio relics associated with merger-driven shock fronts. The
southwest relic exhibits an inverted morphology and shows evidence of spectral
steepening in the post-shock region, potentially tracing a high Mach number
shock ($\sim 4$) under the framework of diffusive shock acceleration. The
northeast relic is found to be highly polarized with a 22% average polarization
fraction at 1.5 GHz and aligned magnetic field vectors. Its spectral and
polarization properties, along with the presence of a nearby tailed galaxy,
support re-acceleration scenarios. The merger axis defined by the two relics is
tilted by $\sim 45$ degree with respect to the plane of the sky, which implies
an unprecedented physical separation of $\sim 3.5$ Mpc. We also detect a
possible faint radio halo, suggesting weak turbulence in the central cluster
region. We conclude that the faint double relics can be best explained by two

accessibility scanning tools exist, most of them perform rule-based check

inaccessible components. Method: ALVIN removes invisible views to prevent
detecting redundancy and uses annotations from low vision users to handle small

that enables the extraction of fiber structures on the micrometer scale, far
smaller than standard X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) setups. Directional and
structural information is relevant in medical diagnostics and material testing.
Compared to existing solutions, AXDT could prove a viable alternative.
Reconstruction methods in AXDT have so far been driven by practicality.
Improved methods could make AXDT more accessible. We contribute numerically
stable implementations and validation of advanced statistical reconstruction
methods that incorporate the statistical noise behavior of the imaging system.
We further provide a new statistical reconstruction formulation that retains
the advanced noise assumptions of the imaging setup while being efficient and
easy to optimize. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of the optimization
behavior for all models regarding AXDT. Our experiments show that statistical
reconstruction outperforms the previously used model, and particularly the
noise performance is superior. While the previously proposed statistical method
is effective, it is computationally expensive, and our newly proposed
formulation proves highly efficient with identical performance. Our theoretical

2501.07789,"Using Statistical Precision Medicine to Identify Optimal Treatments in a
  Heart Failure Setting","Identifying optimal medical treatments to improve survival has long been a
critical goal of pharmacoepidemiology. Traditionally, we use an average
treatment effect measure to compare outcomes between treatment plans. However,
new methods leveraging advantages of machine learning combined with the
foundational tenets of causal inference are offering an alternative to the
average treatment effect. Here, we use three unique, precision medicine
algorithms (random forests, residual weighted learning, efficient augmentation
relaxed learning) to identify optimal treatment rules where patients receive
the optimal treatment as indicated by their clinical history. First, we present
a simple hypothetical example and a real-world application among heart failure
patients using Medicare claims data. We next demonstrate how the optimal
treatment rule improves the absolute risk in a hypothetical, three-modifier
setting. Finally, we identify an optimal treatment rule that optimizes the time
to outcome in a real-world heart failure setting. In both examples, we compare
the average time to death under the optimized, tailored treatment rule with the
average time to death under a universal treatment rule to show the benefit of
precision medicine methods. The improvement under the optimal treatment rule in
the real-world setting is greatest (additional ~9 days under the tailored rule)

study, we test our pipeline for spatially resolved SED fitting using synthetic
images of Euclid, LSST, and GALEX generated from the TNG50 simulation. We apply
our pipeline to 25 local simulated galaxies to recover their resolved stellar
population properties. We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid,
LSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS
models in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust
attenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of
flat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of
mass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and
simulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any
of the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new

cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs
presents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology
foundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS]
token representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is
refereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial
details from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that
leveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly
200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To
address this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature,
which efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a
decoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a
64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we
employ a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ
reconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL)
supervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the
quantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a

2501.1133,Practical Modulo Sampling: Mitigating High-Frequency Components,"Recovering signals within limited dynamic range (DR) constraints remains a
central challenge for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To prevent data
loss, an ADCs DR typically must exceed that of the input signal. Modulo
sampling has recently gained attention as a promising approach for addressing
DR limitations across various signal classes. However, existing methods often
rely on ideal ADCs capable of capturing the high frequencies introduced by the
modulo operator, which is impractical in real-world hardware applications. This
paper introduces an innovative hardware-based sampling approach that addresses
these high-frequency components using an analog mixer followed by a Low-Pass
Filter (LPF). This allows the use of realistic ADCs, which do not need to
handle frequencies beyond the intended sampling rate. Our method eliminates the
requirement for high-specification ADCs and demonstrates that the resulting
samples are equivalent to those from an ideal high-spec ADC. Consequently, any
existing modulo recovery algorithm can be applied effectively. We present a
practical hardware prototype of this approach, validated through both
simulations and hardware recovery experiments. Using a recovery method designed
to handle quantization noise, we show that our approach effectively manages
high-frequency artifacts, enabling reliable modulo recovery with realistic
ADCs. These findings confirm that our hardware solution not only outperforms
conventional methods in high-precision settings but also demonstrates

black hole X-ray binaries in that it has an extra hard component in addition to
a reflection component. We perform spectral analysis with simultaneous
Insight-HXMT, NICER and NuSTAR observations when the source was in the hard and
hard intermediate states. For the presentation of the extra components, we
investigate the correlation between the relxill parameters. We find that the
correlation between the spectral index and the reflection fraction is
consistent with MAXI J1820+070 when the jet dominates the reflection. This
provides the second sample to have such a correlation during an outburst.
Interestingly, when the reflection component is attributed to the corona, the
spectral fit results in a small reflection fraction and the correlation between
the spectral index and reflection fraction is in agreement with the overall
trend built-in You et al. 2023 with a large sample of outbursts from other

quantum simulation, secure quantum communication, and precision measurements.
Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising SPE
candidates due to their atomically thin nature and efficient photon extraction.
However, their emission wavelengths limit compatibility with existing
telecommunication technologies. Lanthanide doping in TMDCs, such as
\defect{MoS}{2}, offers a potential solution by introducing sharp, $f$-orbital
derived emissions in the infrared range. Yet, the feasibility of introducing
these dopants remains uncertain due to their large ionic radii of the
lanthanides. We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
investigate the structural and electronic properties of lanthanide-doped
\defect{MoS}{2} monolayers (Ln=Ce, Er). By evaluating formation energies with
up to three adjacent S vacancies, we assess how these vacancies mitigate
lattice strain caused by the size mismatch of Ce and Er with Mo. Our results
show that while \defect{Ln}{Mo} destabilizes the pristine lattice, S vacancies
enhance thermodynamic stability. Charge state analysis indicates that defect
states introduced by \defect{Ln}{Mo} localize near the valence band and remain
stable across a wide Fermi energy range. Electronic structure analysis shows
that Ce$^{4+}$ and Er$^{3+}$ maintain their oxidation states upon electron
doping due to additional acceptor states from host-induced dangling bonds.
These states arise from an orbital filling mismatch between dopants and Mo.
Consequently, \defect{Ce}{Mo} is unlikely to exhibit infrared emissions due to
its empty $f$-shell, whereas \defect{Er}{Mo} is expected to emit in the
infrared. These findings demonstrate the potential of lanthanide-doped TMDCs as

sequence experience rapid central compaction during starbursts, followed by
inside-out quenching and spatially extended star formation that leads to
expansion, causing oscillatory behavior around the size-mass relation. Notably,
we find a positive intrinsic size-mass relation at high redshift, consistent
with observations but in tension with large-volume simulations. We attribute
this discrepancy to the bursty star formation captured by our multi-phase
interstellar medium framework, but missing from simulations using the effective
equation-of-state approach with hydrodynamically decoupled feedback. We also
find that the normalization of the size-mass relation follows a double power
law as a function of redshift, with a break at $z\approx6$, because the
majority of galaxies at $z > 6$ show rising star-formation histories, and
therefore are in a compaction phase. We demonstrate that H$\alpha$ emission is
systematically extended relative to the UV continuum by a median factor of 1.7,
consistent with recent JWST studies. However, in contrast to previous
interpretations that link extended H$\alpha$ sizes to inside-out growth, we
find that Lyman-continuum (LyC) emission is spatially disconnected from
H$\alpha$. Instead, a simple Str\""{o}mgren sphere argument reproduces observed
trends, suggesting that extreme LyC production during central starbursts is the
primary driver of extended nebular emission.",['astro-ph.GA'],"['McClymont William', 'Tacchella Sandro', 'Smith Aaron', 'Kannan Rahul', 'Puchwein Ewald', 'Borrow Josh', 'Garaldi Enrico', 'Keating Laura', 'Vogelsberger Mark', 'Zier Oliver', 'Shen Xuejian', 'Popovic Filip']",2025-03-06,,False

  testing","Binary classification is a task that involves the classification of data into
one of two distinct classes. It is widely utilized in various fields. However,
conventional classifiers tend to make overconfident predictions for data that
belong to overlapping regions of the two class distributions or for data
outside the distributions (out-of-distribution data). Therefore, conventional
classifiers should not be applied in high-risk fields where classification
results can have significant consequences. In order to address this issue, it
is necessary to quantify uncertainty and adopt decision-making approaches that

however, implementing these methods often requires performing resampling,
improving the structure or performance of models, and optimizing the thresholds
of classifiers. We propose a new decision-making approach using two types of

For a weakly dipolar fluid ($\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a
face-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along
the (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\mu = 2.5$), the

However, existing works treat ground-view and drone-view query images

spatial correlation between the query image and the satellite-view reference

the characteristics of different viewpoints of ground and drone query images,
viewpoint-specific positional codings are designed to more accurately identify
the click-point object of the query image in the VSPE module. In feature-level,
a hybrid attention in the CSHA module is introduced by combining channel

degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In
this paper, we propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer(LEDiT), a
simple yet powerful architecture to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no

introducing causal attention to implicitly impart global positional information

Experiments on 256x256 and 512x512 ImageNet show that LEDiT can scale the
inference resolution to 512x512 and 1024x1024, respectively, while achieving

  evolution","Observations have established that the masses of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs) correlate tightly with the stellar masses of their host galaxies,
albeit with substantial scatter. The size of this scatter as a function of
galaxy mass and redshift contains valuable information about the origin of
SMBHs and the physical nature of their co-evolution with galaxies. In this
work, we highlight this connection by studying the scatter in the
$M_{\mathrm{BH}} - M_{\star}$ relation for massive galaxies in the Illustris,
IllustrisTNG (TNG), and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We find that the
scatter in TNG is significantly lower than in Illustris and EAGLE, reflecting
their different BH feedback models. By performing various numerical
experiments, we quantify different contributions to the scatter in the
simulations, and also identify a suitably defined intrinsic scatter. The
intrinsic scatter in Illustris and EAGLE is $\sim0.3$ dex at $z=0$, and is
dominated by variations from BH accretion, whereas the smaller scatter of TNG
is rather dominated by hierarchical merging, suggesting that the massive
galaxies in TNG are more tightly quenched. Variations in the BH seed mass can
contribute to the scatter of the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relation as well, but
whether this still plays a role at $z=0$ depends on the feedback model.
Simulations with disabled AGN feedback produce much higher scatter for low-mass
galaxies than seen in our cosmological simulations, demonstrating the crucial
influence of feedback for determining the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host
galaxies in this regime. In contrast, an important factor in reducing the
scatter for massive galaxies is hierarchical merging of mostly quenched
systems. Based on our results, we expect that the scatter in the

encoding ensures mutual equality: each pair of symbols is equidistant on the
Bloch sphere. Also, since permutation invariance is inherent to common DNA
similarity measures such as Levenshtein distance, we realize it by using a
specially designed parameterized quantum layer. We show that our novel encoding

understanding that aims to localize the target moment in videos specified by a

from its population (students are often children, who can be especially

radial-instability which leads to a decrease in bundle radius, and migration of
filaments relative to each other in the bundle. Nonetheless, the helical angle
of the filaments in the bundle are found to be essentially constant, resulting
in inclination angles which increase with distance from axis of rotation. We
develop energy minimization analysis to capture the observed variations in

  Graphics","Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for
enhancing math education by automating support for both teachers and students.
While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality
distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored.
Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet
manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific
expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating
diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures
using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms
such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and
hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related
diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We
address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math
diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG
is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what
prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate
SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of
automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM
prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram
generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based
evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline
variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students

evolution of jets and in the emission of high-energy radiation. Additionally,
the full comprehension of this phenomenon provides insights into fundamental
properties of jets in the vicinity of the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
Three-dimensional (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations revealed that the jet
conditions at recollimation favor the growth of strong instabilities,
challenging the traditional view-supported from two-dimensional simulations-of
confined jets undergoing a series of recollimation and reflection shocks. To
investigate the stability of relativistic jets in AGNs at recollimation sites,
we perform a set of long duration three-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations with the state-of-the-art PLUTO code, to focus on the development
of hydrodynamical instabilities. We explore the non-linear growth of the
instabilities and their effects on the physical jet properties as a function of
the initial jet parameters: jet Lorentz factor, temperature, opening angle and
jet-environment density-contrast. The parameter space is designed to describe
low-power, weakly magnetized jets at small distances from the core (around the
parsec scale). All collimating jets we simulated develop instabilities.
Recollimation instabilities decelerate the jet, heat it, entrain external
material, and move the recollimation point to shorter distances from the core.
This is true for both conical and cylindrical jets. The instabilities, that are
first triggered by the centrifugal instability, appear to be less disruptive in
the case of narrower, denser, more relativistic, and warmer jets. These results

First, we disclose that the dynamical exponent features two distinct plateaus

Given the unphysical nature of such random perturbations, this work examines

radius ($r_{\rm eff}$) of $170 \pm 140$ pc. They follow a distinct
size-luminosity relation, with an intercept at $M_{\rm UV} = -21$ approximately
three times smaller than typical star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at similar
redshifts. This relation, however, is consistent with that of low-redshift
Green Pea galaxies, suggesting that LAEs maintain compact sizes across
redshifts. We also find that Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW(Ly$\alpha$))
increases with decreasing $r_{\rm eff}$, confirming previous findings. The
small sizes of LAEs lead to high star formation surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR

small variation in metallicity, ~0.1 dex, for the first generation (FG) stars
in NGC 3201 and NGC 104. However, in both cases the claim is not robust because
of the internal error of 0.1 dex associated to the [Fe/H] values. To verify the
reality of a metallicity variation we compared the two analyses, performed by
the same authors with identical methodology. We found trends of metallicity as
a function of the spectroscopically derived effective temperatures. However
they are in opposite directions; in NGC 3201 cooler (and brighter) stars have
higher [Fe/H] values, whereas in 47 Tuc they show lower metallicities. The
trend is not statistically significant in the former case, but it is in the
latter. The dependence of metallicity on the luminosity along the red giant
branch seems to indicate problems in the abundance analysis for 47 Tuc.
Finally, effective temperature do not show a significant variation as a
function of the color spread along the HST pseudo-colour map, which we should

  Text-Aware One-Dimensional Tokens","Image tokenizers form the foundation of modern text-to-image generative
models but are notoriously difficult to train. Furthermore, most existing
text-to-image models rely on large-scale, high-quality private datasets, making
them challenging to replicate. In this work, we introduce Text-Aware
Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TA-TiTok), an efficient and powerful
image tokenizer that can utilize either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional
tokens. TA-TiTok uniquely integrates textual information during the tokenizer
decoding stage (i.e., de-tokenization), accelerating convergence and enhancing
performance. TA-TiTok also benefits from a simplified, yet effective, one-stage
training process, eliminating the need for the complex two-stage distillation
used in previous 1-dimensional tokenizers. This design allows for seamless
scalability to large datasets. Building on this, we introduce a family of
text-to-image Masked Generative Models (MaskGen), trained exclusively on open
data while achieving comparable performance to models trained on private data.
We aim to release both the efficient, strong TA-TiTok tokenizers and the

tools for analysis of strongly correlated wave functions. They can
quantitatively measure how strongly an orbital (e.g. from the DMRG active
space) participates in the strong correlation and reveal the entanglement
pattern between different orbitals. However, this pattern can become rather
complicated and sometimes difficult to interpret for large active spaces and is
not invariant with respect to the spin projection ($M_s$) component of the spin
multiplet state. We introduce a modified spin-free orbital entropy, pair
entropy, and mutual information, which simplify the entanglement analysis and
are invariant with respect to $M_s$. By comparison of these quantities with
their ``original'' spin-including counterparts one can distinguish static
correlation due to spin couplings from the ``genuine'' strong correlation due
to a multiconfigurational character of the wave function. We illustrate the
approach on a model consisting of a non-interacting dimer of triplet diradicals

Differential Privacy (DP), a widely adopted privacy safeguard, has emerged to

  $\rm H_2$","This work presents a detailed description of the thermochemical
non-equilibrium dissociation of diatomic molecules, and applies this theory to
the case of $\rm H_2$ dissociation. The master equations are used to derive
corresponding aggregate rate constant expressions that hold for any degree of
thermochemical non-equilibrium. These general expressions are analyzed in three
key limits/ regimes: the thermal equilibrium limit, the quasi-steady-state
(QSS) regime, and the pre-QSS regime. Under several simplifying assumptions, an
analytical source term expression that holds in all of these regimes, and is
only a function of the translational temperature, $T_{\rm t}$, and the fraction
of dissociation, $\phi_{\rm A}$, is proposed. This expression has two input
parameters: the QSS dissociation rate constant in the absence of recombination,
$k_{\rm d,nr}(T_{\rm t})$, and a pre-QSS correction factor, $\eta(T_{\rm t})$.
The value of $\eta(T_{\rm t})$ is evaluated by comparing the predictions of the
proposed expression against existing master equation simulations of a 0-D
isothermal and isochoric reactor for the case of $\rm H_2$ dissociation with
the third-bodies $\rm H_2$, $\rm H$, and $\rm He$. Despite its simple

considered for the third-bodies $\rm H_2$, $\rm H$, and inert gases, and fits

for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of
supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation
between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD
accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic
center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct
counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux
tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux
tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by
the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots,
formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they
travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light.
Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance
out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk
and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with
the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor
face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ,

proposed as key candidates responsible for the UV-upturn phenomenon. We have
analyzed all related physical processes, including stellar evolution, initial

elliptical galaxies, which are intrinsic UV-upturn galaxies induced by EHB
stars within their old stellar populations, and dusty star-forming galaxies,
which are relatively young and may also be photometrically identified as
UV-upturn galaxies when accounting for dust attenuation. Dust attenuation
contributes to 20%-60% of the UV-upturn galaxies, depending on the specific
dust attenuation models adopted. With the binary star formation model of EHB

prevalence of the many proposed BBH formation channels, the spin properties of
the merging black holes (BHs) hold significant promise, particularly their
orientations. The combined trends of a moderate preferential alignment of BH
spins with their orbit normals and an apparent correlation of BBH effective
spin parameters $\chi_{\rm eff}$ with their mass ratios seem to favor
hydrodynamical BBH formation mechanisms over purely dynamical ones, as they
introduce a preferred orientation to the system. However, such processes are
filled with physical and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we highlight a
dynamical route to easily characterizable spin evolution that results in
analytically-predictable spin distributions. We show that, when a stellar
binary forms a BBH through two phases of stable mass transfer, and the BBH is
subsequently driven to merger by the gravitational perturbation of a distant
massive object (such as a supermassive black hole), the resulting spin-orbit
misalignment angles are anti-correlated with the binary mass ratio. While the

addresses these performance challenges by enabling a graph-based execution

graph. Thereby consolidating several kernel launches into one graph launch. We
propose a performance optimization strategy for iteratively launched kernels.
By grouping kernel launches into iteration batches and then unrolling these

for performance boosting. We analyze the performance gain and overhead from
this approach by designing a skeleton application. The skeleton application
also serves as a generalized example of converting an iterative solver to CUDA

show that when unrolling iteration batches for a given platform, there is an
optimal size of the iteration batch, which is independent of workload,
balancing the extra overhead from graph creation with the performance gain of
the graph execution. Depending on workload, we show that the optimal iteration

transforming system design by promoting decentralization and allowing
development teams to work independently on specific microservices. While
loosely coupled microservices are ideal, dependencies between them are
inevitable. Often, these dependencies go unnoticed by development teams.
Although syntactic dependencies can be identified, tracking semantic
dependencies - when multiple microservices share similar logic - poses a
greater challenge. As systems evolve, changes made to one microservice can
trigger ripple effects, jeopardizing system consistency and requiring updates
to dependent services, which increases maintenance and operational complexity.
Effectively tracking different types of dependencies across microservices is
essential for anticipating the impact of such changes. This paper introduces
the Semantic Dependency Matrix as an instrument to address these challenges
from a semantic perspective. We propose an automated approach to extract and
represent these dependencies and demonstrate its effectiveness through a case
study. This paper takes a step further by demonstrating the significance of
semantic dependencies, even in cases where there are no direct dependencies

nanodroplets in a high Ohnesorge number regime (0.4 < Oh < 1) on a
superhydrophobic surface and the dynamics of droplets when a stationary droplet
on a solid surface is struck by another droplet of similar size from above,
using molecular dynamics simulation. The first part of this study identified
the critical droplet size below which coalescence-induced jumping terminates,
developed a universal jumping mechanism for droplets of all types, explained a
special phenomenon of jumping velocity becoming maximum before it approaches
zero, and investigated how jumping terminates due to the size difference
between droplets. These findings align well with prior micro-level studies and
experimental predictions. The second part of this study investigated the
jumping process of the merged droplet after the impact of a moving droplet upon
a stationary one. The impact velocity, droplet size, surface textures, and
wettability are influential factors on the jumping velocity in this case.
Scaling laws for maximum spreading time, spreading factor, and restitution
coefficient are formulated based on the Weber (We) number and the Reynolds (Re)
number. These laws differ from those established for single-droplet impacts.
For superhydrophobic surfaces, the spreading time is approximated by three
times the droplet radius and impact velocity, and with the dimensionless
spreading time, it exhibits a linear relationship with We 0.31. For both cases,
the jumping process is primarily governed by the energy available for
conversion into the kinetic energy of the merged droplet following dissipation.
For the droplet impact case, the energy conversion efficiency becomes constant

dislocation density was reduced compared to H-free samples, localized bands of
dislocations were produced. Additionally in the polycrystalline samples, it was

translation length over all pseudo Anosovs in a fixed genus that lie in a
hyperelliptic component of translation surfaces. In particular, this minimum is
always greater than $\log(\sqrt{2}),$ independently of the genus. Here, we show
that the minimal stable curve graph translation length over the same family of

sub-linear regret for all three cases. In particular, under a shifting
stochastic adversary where the distribution may shift $S$ times, we provide an
$\epsilon$-differentially private algorithm whose expected dynamic regret is at
most $O\left( \sqrt{S T \log (NT)} + \frac{S \log (NT)}{\epsilon}\right)$,

For oblivious adversaries, we give a reduction from dynamic regret minimization

the expected dynamic regret, where $S$ now denotes the allowable number of
switches of the best expert. Finally, similar to static regret, we establish a
fundamental separation between oblivious and adaptive adversaries for the
dynamic setting: while our algorithms show that sub-linear regret is achievable
for oblivious adversaries in the high-privacy regime $\epsilon \le \sqrt{S/T}$,
we show that any $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithm must

  Retention","Machine Unlearning allows participants to remove their data from a trained
machine learning model in order to preserve their privacy, and security.
However, the machine unlearning literature for generative models is rather
limited. The literature for image-to-image generative model (I2I model)
considers minimizing the distance between Gaussian noise and the output of I2I
model for forget samples as machine unlearning. However, we argue that the
machine learning model performs fairly well on unseen data i.e., a retrained
model will be able to catch generic patterns in the data and hence will not
generate an output which is equivalent to Gaussian noise. In this paper, we
consider that the model after unlearning should treat forget samples as
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, i.e., the unlearned model should no longer
recognize or encode the specific patterns found in the forget samples. To
achieve this, we propose a framework which decouples the model parameters with
gradient ascent, ensuring that forget samples are OOD for unlearned model with
theoretical guarantee. We also provide $(\epsilon, \delta)$-unlearning
guarantee for model updates with gradient ascent. The unlearned model is
further fine-tuned on the remaining samples to maintain its performance. We
also propose an attack model to ensure that the unlearned model has effectively
removed the influence of forget samples. Extensive empirical evaluation on two

routing scheme of Chechik [PODC 2013]. We improve the handshake stretch to the
optimal \((2k-1)\), by introducing the concept of roundtrip routing in
undirected graphs and developing an optimal \((2k-1)\)-stretch compact

First, the integration of delay-Doppler waveform and MIMO is explored by

neural framework for SPDE estimation that eliminates the need for
discretization, enabling direct estimation of expected values across arbitrary
spatio-temporal points. We develop and compare two distinct neural
architectures: Loss Enforced Conditions (LEC), which integrates physical
constraints into the loss function, and Model Enforced Conditions (MEC), which
embeds these constraints directly into the network structure. Through extensive
experiments on the stochastic heat equation, Burgers' equation, and
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation, we reveal a trade-off: While LEC achieves
superior residual minimization and generalization, MEC enforces initial
conditions with absolute precision and exceptionally high accuracy in boundary
condition enforcement. Our findings highlight the immense potential of
neural-based SPDE solvers, particularly for high-dimensional problems where
conventional techniques falter. By circumventing discretization and explicitly
modeling uncertainty, our approach opens new avenues for solving SPDEs in
fields ranging from quantitative finance to turbulence modeling. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first neural framework capable of directly
estimating the expected values of SPDEs in an entirely non-discretized manner,

2501.04376,"Exploring Unbiased Deepfake Detection via Token-Level Shuffling and
  Mixing","The generalization problem is broadly recognized as a critical challenge in
detecting deepfakes. Most previous work believes that the generalization gap is
caused by the differences among various forgery methods. However, our
investigation reveals that the generalization issue can still occur when
forgery-irrelevant factors shift. In this work, we identify two biases that
detectors may also be prone to overfitting: position bias and content bias, as
depicted in Fig. 1. For the position bias, we observe that detectors are prone
to lazily depending on the specific positions within an image (e.g., central
regions even no forgery). As for content bias, we argue that detectors may
potentially and mistakenly utilize forgery-unrelated information for detection
(e.g., background, and hair). To intervene these biases, we propose two
branches for shuffling and mixing with tokens in the latent space of
transformers. For the shuffling branch, we rearrange the tokens and
corresponding position embedding for each image while maintaining the local
correlation. For the mixing branch, we randomly select and mix the tokens in
the latent space between two images with the same label within the mini-batch
to recombine the content information. During the learning process, we align the
outputs of detectors from different branches in both feature space and logit
space. Contrastive losses for features and divergence losses for logits are
applied to obtain unbiased feature representation and classifiers. We

$s$-edge colourings in an $n$-vertex graph which avoid a monochromatic copy of
$K_k$, given positive integers $n,s,k$. In this paper, we systematically study
the generalisation of this problem to a given forbidden family of colourings of
$K_k$. This problem typically exhibits a dichotomy whereby for some values of
$s$, the extremal graph is the `trivial' one, namely the Tur\'an graph on $k-1$
parts, with no copies of $K_k$; while for others, this graph is no longer
extremal and determining the extremal graph becomes much harder.
  We generalise a framework developed for the monochromatic
Erd\H{o}s-Rothschild problem to the general setting and work in this framework

triangles with exactly two colours, and improperly coloured cliques. We

  and Quality Factor Enhancement","To date, nearly all the reported Lamb wave resonators (LWRs) are straight
crested LWRs, which suffer from inherent spurious modes and low quality factors
(Q). For the first time, this work demonstrates a circular crested LWR. Its
advantages over the straight crested LWR are presented comprehensively by
studying their fundamental symmetric (S0) mode, which is the simplest and most
representative Lamb wave mode. Utilizing circular crested Lamb waves, the
proposed resonator avoids only utilizing waves propagating in the lateral
direction in the straight crested LWRs, thus eliminating the transverse
spurious modes as no transverse direction exists. Besides, different from
straight crested Lamb waves maintaining the same displacement amplitude along
the propagation direction, circular crested Lamb waves exhibit displacement
attenuation toward device edges, which effectively concentrates energy in the
device center, assists in reducing energy loss through anchors, and improves Q.
Based on 20 at.% scandium-doped aluminum nitride (Al0.8Sc0.2N) thin films, the
microfabricated circular crested LWR effectively suppresses transverse spurious
modes and achieves a 40.7% Q improvement in experiments with no degradation in
effective electromechanical coupling coefficients (keff2) compared with the
conventional straight crested LWR when working in S0 mode in experiments, in
contrast with the conventional straight crested LWR which shows inherent
experimental transverse spurious modes. Moreover, the free edges covered by top
electrodes enhance device robustness against misalignment and over-etching in
the fabrication process. With the advantages of spurious mode suppression, Q
enhancement, and fabrication robustness, the circular crested LWR is a
promising candidate for next-generation filters and oscillators.",['physics.app-ph'],"['Lu Xianzheng', 'Lou Liang', 'Ren Hao']",2025-01-01,,False

transfer pathways in condensed matter systems. The possibility of inferring the
strength of specific coupling channels from their characteristic time scales
measured in nonequilibrium experiments is still an open question. Here, we
investigate MgB$_2$, in which conventional superconductivity at temperatures as
high as 39 K is mediated by the strong coupling between the conduction
electrons and the E$_{2g}$ phonon mode. By means of broadband time-resolved
optical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling
dictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$ at early times (<100
fs) after photoexcitation. Furthermore, based on an effective temperature model
analysis, we estimate its contribution to the total electron-boson coupling
function extracted from complementary equilibrium spectroscopy approaches,
namely optical reflectivity and ARPES. The coupling strength with the E$_{2g}$
phonon modes is thus estimated to be $\lambda$ ~ 0.56, which is approximately
half of the total coupling constant, in agreement with ab-initio calculations

latency in modern decentralized applications. Replicated Data Types (RDTs) have
emerged as a principled approach for developing replicated implementations of
basic data structures such as counter, flag, set, map, etc. While the
correctness of RDTs is generally specified using the notion of strong eventual
consistency--which guarantees that replicas that have received the same set of
updates would converge to the same state--a more expressive specification which
relates the converged state to updates received at a replica would be more
beneficial to RDT users. Replication-aware linearizability is one such
specification, which requires all replicas to always be in a state which can be
obtained by linearizing the updates received at the replica. In this work, we
develop a novel fully automated technique for verifying replication-aware
linearizability for Mergeable Replicated Data Types (MRDTs). We identify novel
algebraic properties for MRDT operations and the merge function which are
sufficient for proving an implementation to be linearizable and which go beyond
the standard notions of commutativity, associativity, and idempotence. We also
develop a novel inductive technique called bottom-up linearization to

in those cases (such as low entanglement or low non-Clifford gate count) where
one can independently learn efficient classical descriptions of each state
using established techniques and share the description to compute the overlap.
Instead, our results demonstrate that this is possible even in more complex

exponentially localized at one side of the lattice (skin effect), it is

Building on this foundation, we introduce a versatile suite of coherence

refining the Massen-Uffink bound to account for the largest eigenvalues across
distinct measurement bases. This refinement forges a deeper connection between

understanding the physical processes of black hole accretion systems at
different scales. When applying this rule to high-frequency quasi-periodic
oscillations (HFQPOs), there is an observation-theory confrontation in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). By compiling an updated X-ray HFQPO catalog, we found
that the ultraluminous X-ray sources support the HFQPO models, similar to black
hole X-ray binaries. More importantly, we identified two supermassive black
hole (SMBH) sources (Sgr A and NGC 1365) with possible advection-dominated
accretion flow (ADAF) configurations that support existing HFQPO models, even
though many AGNs still do not. Furthermore, we report a new HFQPO candidate in
NGC 5506. This source exhibits an accretion state similar to that of Sgr A* and
NGC 1365, and it also supports the HFQPO models. Our results are consistent
with previous numerical simulations and suggest that the accretion state of
HFQPOs in SMBHs may differ from that of stellar-mass black holes (SBHs). To
reconcile the sources that do not support the models, either a global
general-relativistic HFQPO model based on magnetohydrodynamics needs to be
considered, or the HFQPOs in these sources may originate from entirely
different physical processes. This discovery significantly extends the SIAP

high-performance Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for VQAs. However,
existing QAS algorithms grapple with excessively large search spaces, resulting
in significant computational complexity when searching large-scale quantum

identify optimal circuit topologies and subsequently utilizes an efficient QAS
to fine-tune gate types. In the fine-tuning phase, the QAS inherits parameters
from the topology search phase, thereby eliminating the need to train from
scratch. By decoupling the extensive search space into topology and gate-type
components, TD-QAS avoids exploring gate configurations within low-performance
topologies, significantly reducing computational complexity. Numerical
simulations across various tasks, under both noiseless and noisy scenario,
demonstrate that the TD-QAS framework enhances the efficiency of QAS algorithms
by enabling them to identify high-performance quantum circuits with lower

are influenced by various biases, including duration bias, demographic biases,

predicted behavior distributions across different bias conditions using
quantile mapping, theoretically guaranteeing zero mutual information between
bias variables and the true user interest. By explicitly modeling the
conditional distributions of user behaviors under different biases and mapping
these behaviors to quantiles, we effectively decouple user interest from the
confounding effects of various biases. Our approach uniquely handles both

we identify that the bias towards the frequent class may be encoded into
features, i.e., the rare-specific features which play a key role in
discriminating the rare class are much weaker than the frequent-specific

decoupling the direction and magnitude of parameters in BN layer to learn, the
Weight/Bias exhibits a more balanced distribution and thus the strength of

limit their applicability in the unpredictable and dynamic wild. In this work,
we investigate $\textbf{Universal Incremental Learning (UIL)}$, where a model
neither knows which new classes or domains will increase along sequential
tasks, nor the scale of the increments within each task. This uncertainty
prevents the model from confidently learning knowledge from all task
distributions and symmetrically focusing on the diverse knowledge within each

telescope. The survey covers the sky area of -89<Dec<0 and the frequency range
of 1.3-1.8 GHz split into 1-MHz channels. STAPS was observed commensally with
the S-band Polarization All-Sky Survey (S-PASS). The survey is composed of long
azimuth scans, which allows us to absolutely calibrate Stokes Q and U with the
data processing procedure developed for S-PASS. We obtain I, Q, and U maps in
both flux density scale (Jy/beam) and main beam brightness temperature scale
(K), for the 301 frequency channels with sufficiently good data. The
temperature scale is tied to the Global Magneto-ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS)
high-band north sky survey conducted with the Dominion Radio Astrophysical
Observatory 26-m telescope. All the STAPS maps are smoothed to a common
resolution of 20 arcmin. The rms noise per channel ranges from about 16 mK to 8
mK for I, and from about 8 mK to 5 mK for Q and U at frequencies from 1.3 to
1.8 GHz. The rms noise in Q and U varies with declination and reaches minimum
at declination of -89 degree. We also run rotation measure (RM) synthesis and
RM clean to obtain peak polarized intensity and Faraday depth maps. The whole
STAPS data processing is validated by comparing flux densities of compact
sources, pixel flux density versus pixel flux density for Cen A, pixel
temperature versus pixel temperature for the entire survey area, and RMs of
extragalactic sources between STAPS and other measurements. The uncertainty of
the flux density scale is less than 10%. STAPS delivers an L-band (20 cm)
multi-frequency polarization view of the Galaxy, and will help advance our
understanding of the Galactic magnetic field and magnetized interstellar
medium.",['astro-ph.GA'],"['Sun Xiaohui', 'Haverkorn Marijke', 'Carretti Ettore', 'Landecker Tom', 'Gaensler B. M.', 'Poppi Sergio', 'Staveley-Smith Lister', 'Gao Xuyang', 'Han Jinlin']",2025-01-23,,False

2503.04076,"Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of
  LLMs for Java Code Snippets","Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often
found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type
information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent
studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code
snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially
affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public
on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs'
strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere
retrieval of ground truth from training data.
  To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code
snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a
program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for
type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped
significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall.
Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly
degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in
understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the
minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference
primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly
infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a
reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the
snippets.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from
data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code
snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed
benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs
for type inference tasks.",['cs.SE'],"['Dong Yiwen', 'Xu Zhenyang', 'Tian Yongqiang', 'Sun Chengnian']",2025-03-05,,False
2502.15344,Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair,"Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as
expressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can
express properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and
responsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism
for the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties.
Our produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in
test-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside
the given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework
based on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis,
which readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified
negation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties
into Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to
pass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism
for Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL).
However, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for
expressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to
stratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite
computations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach
achieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a
real-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and

submodules $N$ of $M_n$ such that $f_n(N)$ is contained in the radical of the

isomorphic $\R(R)$-semimodules. We provide conditions under which $H_n(\R(-))$

sequence of complexes of $R$-modules, and satisfies the naturality condition

ratios in methane on the KBOs Eris and Makemake, providing new insights into
their origins. This study examines the elevated D/H ratios in methane on these
KBOs in the context of protosolar nebula dynamics and chemistry, and proposes a
primordial origin for the methane, in contrast to previous hypotheses

The results suggest that methane on these KBOs likely originates from the
protosolar nebula, similar to cometary methane, and was sequestered in solid
form -- either as pure condensates or clathrates -- within their building

certification of angular-momentum entanglement in photon pairs. In particular,
measurements in only two experimentally accessible bases are sufficient to
obtain a lower bound on the entanglement dimension for both two- and

We then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified
as X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other
physical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11
out of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies
classified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected
for their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized
HI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best
fitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the
X-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the
interplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the
galactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals

2501.05221,"RUM-NN: A Neural Network Model Compatible with Random Utility
  Maximisation for Discrete Choice Setups","This paper introduces a framework for capturing stochasticity of choice
probabilities in neural networks, derived from and fully consistent with the
Random Utility Maximization (RUM) theory, referred to as RUM-NN. Neural network
models show remarkable performance compared with statistical models; however,
they are often criticized for their lack of transparency and interoperability.
The proposed RUM-NN is introduced in both linear and nonlinear structures. The
linear RUM-NN retains the interpretability and identifiability of traditional
econometric discrete choice models while using neural network-based estimation
techniques. The nonlinear RUM-NN extends the model's flexibility and predictive
capabilities to capture nonlinear relationships between variables within
utility functions. Additionally, the RUM-NN allows for the implementation of
various parametric distributions for unobserved error components in the utility
function and captures correlations among error terms. The performance of RUM-NN
in parameter recovery and prediction accuracy is rigorously evaluated using
synthetic datasets through Monte Carlo experiments. Additionally, RUM-NN is
evaluated on the Swissmetro and the London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)
datasets with different sets of distribution assumptions for the error
component. The results demonstrate that RUM-NN under a linear utility structure
and IID Gumbel error terms can replicate the performance of the Multinomial
Logit (MNL) model, but relaxing those constraints leads to superior performance
for both Swissmetro and LPMC datasets. By introducing a novel estimation
approach aligned with statistical theories, this study empowers econometricians

investigated the CP violation in the cascade decay process $D^0(t_1) \to \pi^0
K(t_2) \to \pi^0(\pi^\pm \ell^\mp \nu)$. Our results indicate that the CP

introduce a contract design problem in which a provider sells a service that
results in an outcome of uncertain quality for the buyer. The seller has a set
of actions that lead to different distributions over outcomes. We focus on a
setting in which the seller has the ability to commit to an action and the
buyer is free to accept or reject the outcome after seeing its realized
quality. We propose a two-stage payment scheme where the seller designs a menu
of contracts, each of which specifies an action, an upfront price and a vector
of outcome-dependent usage prices. Upon selecting a contract, the buyer pays
the upfront price, and after observing the realized outcome, the buyer either
accepts and pays the corresponding usage price, or rejects and is exempt from
further payment. We show that this two-stage payment structure is necessary to
maximize profit: only upfront prices or only usage prices is insufficient. We
then study the computational complexity of computing a profit-maximizing menu
in our model. While computing the exact maximum seller profit is NP-hard even
for two buyer types, we derive a fully-polynomial time approximation scheme

  Reconstruction from Sparse Image Sequences","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive rendering performance in
novel view synthesis. However, its efficacy diminishes considerably in sparse
image sequences, where inherent data sparsity amplifies geometric uncertainty

scenes.To mitigate these issues, we propose Uncertainty-aware Normal-Guided
Gaussian Splatting (UNG-GS), a novel framework featuring an explicit Spatial

Gaussian-based probabilistic modeling into the training of 3DGS to optimize the
SUF, providing the model with adaptive error tolerance. An uncertainty-aware
depth rendering strategy is then employed to weight depth contributions based
on the SUF, effectively reducing noise while preserving fine details.
Furthermore, an uncertainty-guided normal refinement method adjusts the

2502.20542,Conversational Concurrency with Dataspaces and Facets,"Context: Developers have come to appreciate the simplicity of message-passing
actors for concurrent programming tasks. The actor model of computation is easy
to grasp; it is just a conversation among actors with a common goal.
Importantly, it eliminates some basic pitfalls of the dominant shared-memory
model, most critically data races.
  Inquiry: A close look at real-world conversations suggests, however, that
they are not mere exchanges of messages. Participants must keep in mind
conversational context, and participants joining late can and often must
acquire some of this context. In addition, some settings call for engaging in
several conversations in parallel; in others, participants conduct temporarily
limited sub-conversations to clarify a point. Existing actor code exhibits
complex design patterns that get around the underlying limitations of the pure
message-passing model.
  Approach: These patterns suggest a number of elements involved in programming
conversational computations. Translated into terms of language design, they
call for two kinds of facilities: (1) one for sharing conversational context
and (2) another one for organizing individual actors around on-going
conversations and their contexts.
  Knowledge: This paper presents Syndicate, a language designed to directly
support the programming of conversing actors. Beyond message passing, it
supplies (1) a dataspace, which allows actors to make public assertions, to
withdraw them, and to query what other actors have asserted; and (2) the facet
notation, which enables programmers to express individual actors as a
reflection of the on-going conversations.
  Grounding: A worked example introduces these concepts and illustrates
conversational programming in Syndicate. A comparison with other research and
industrial concurrent languages demonstrates the unique support Syndicate
provides.
  Importance: Syndicate advances concurrent actor programming with enhancements
that address some observed limitations of the underlying model. While
message-passing simplifies concurrent programming, it falls short in handling
the complexities of actual computational conversations. By introducing a
dataspace actor for sharing conversational context and the facet notation for
organizing actors around ongoing conversations, Syndicate enables developers to
naturally express and manage the nuanced interactions often required in
concurrent systems. These innovations reduce the need for complex design

saving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial

generate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we
evolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the

2502.16429,"A Joint Learning Framework for Bridging Defect Prediction and
  Interpretation","Over the past fifty years, numerous software defect prediction (SDP)
approaches have been proposed. However, the ability to explain why predictors
make certain predictions remains limited. Explainable SDP has emerged as a
promising solution by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods
to clarify the decision-making processes of predictors. Despite this progress,
there is still significant potential to enhance the reliability of existing
approaches. To address this limitation, we treat defect prediction and the
corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks and
propose a joint learning framework that allows for the simultaneous training of
the predictor and its interpreter. The novelty of our approach lies in two main
aspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from
the predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in
decision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the
interpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global
interpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty
term in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only
improves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint
on the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against
several existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results
demonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction. The

Accordingly, we progressively construct the configuration space by sampling
from the discretized space and updating the bitmap cells representing obstacle
regions. Subsequently, we partition this partially built configuration space to

estimates of star clusters in nearby spiral galaxies. However, feedback from
young cluster stars pushes out the natal gas and dust, making cluster formation
and evolution a challenge to model. Here, we use JWST + HST observations of the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 to produce spectral energy distribution (SED)
templates of compact star clusters spanning 275 nm through 21 {\mu}m. These
preliminary SEDs capture the cluster stars and associated gas and dust within
radii of 0.12"" to 0.67"" (corresponding to 6 to 33 pc at the distance of NGC
628). One important finding is that the SEDs of 1, 2, 3, and 4 Myr clusters can
be differentiated in the infrared. Another is that in 80-90% of the cases we
study, the PAH and H_alpha emission track one another, with the dust
responsible for the 3.3 {\mu}m PAH emission largely removed by 4 Myr,
consistent with pre-supernova stellar feedback acting quickly on the
surrounding gas and dust. Nearly-embedded cluster candidates have infrared SEDs
which are quite similar to optically visible 1 to 3 Myr clusters. In nearly all
cases we find there is a young star cluster within a few tenths of an arcsec
(10 - 30 pc) of the nearly embedded cluster, suggesting the formation of the

the chemistry of their atmospheres and interpreting their observations requires
the use of chemical kinetic models including photochemistry. The thermal
dependence of the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) absorption cross sections of
molecules used in these models is poorly known at high temperatures, leading to
uncertainties in the resulting abundance profiles. The aim of our work is to
study experimentally the thermal dependence of VUV absorption cross sections of
molecules of interest for exoplanet atmospheres and provide accurate data for
use in atmospheric models. This study focuses on acetylene (C2H2). We measured
absorption cross sections of C2H2 at seven temperatures ranging from 296 to 773
K recorded in the 115-230 nm spectral domain using VUV spectroscopy and
synchrotron radiation. These data were used in our 1D thermo-photochemical
model, to assess their impact on the predicted composition of a generic hot
Jupiter-like exoplanet atmosphere. The absolute absorption cross sections of
C2H2 increase with temperature. This increase is relatively constant from 115

calculated using the model shows a slight variation, with a maximum decrease of
40% near 5 x 10-5 bar, when using C2H2 absorption cross sections measured at
773 K compared to those at 296 K. This is explained by the absorption, higher
in the atmosphere, of the actinic flux from 150 to 230 nm due to the increase
in the C2H2 absorption in this spectral range. This change also impacts the
abundance profiles of other by-products such as methane (CH4) and ethylene

formation history, parametrised by T50, T70, and T90. We find that early-type
void galaxies are, on average, 10-20% smaller than their counterparts in denser
environments, regardless of their mass assembly history. Moreover, the
mass-size relation for massive early-type void galaxies has a shallower slope
compared to those in denser regions. In contrast, early-type galaxies in
filaments, and clusters show a more uniform mass-size relation. Late-type
cluster galaxies with stellar masses $log(M_{\star} / M_{\odot}) = 9 - 10.5$
are smaller and more concentrated than their counterparts in lower-density
environments, such as filaments, and voids. We conclude that large-scale
environments influence the mass-size relation. Early-type galaxies appear to
grow most of their mass during the initial formation phase. Subsequent size
growth in voids is less significant, likely due to slower evolution, reduced
minor merger activity, fewer accretion events, or a combination. The flatter
slope for massive void galaxies indicates a lower rate of minor accretion, a
trend also observed in late-type void galaxies with $\approx 10^{10.5}

(LVLMs). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention
as a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from
constructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in
responses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data
construction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We
identify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the
constructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO.
Theoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by
the presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference
policy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically
summarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address
hallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment
(OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct
hallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised
responses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO
achieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B:
13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared
to the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples. Our implementation is

2501.16532,"Anti-thixotropic dynamics in attractive colloidal dispersions: a shear
  restructuring driven by elastic stresses","Due to rich rheological properties, dispersions of attractive colloidal
particles are ubiquitous in industries. Specifically, upon experiencing a
sudden reduction in shear rate, these dispersions may exhibit transient
behaviors such as thixotropy-where viscosity increases over time-and
anti-thixotropy, characterized by an initial viscosity decrease before reaching
a steady state. While thixotropy has been described as a competition between
structure buildup and disruption, the mechanisms of anti-thixotropy remain
poorly understood. Here, we investigate the anti-thixotropic dynamics of carbon
black particles dispersed in oil-a system known for exhibiting
anti-thixotropy-through flow step-down experiments. Using a multi-technique
approach combining rheology with velocimetry and structural characterizations,
we show that viscosity decrease results from a decrease in wall slip
concomitant to shear-induced structural rearrangements, indicating a transition
from a dynamical network of fractal clusters into a network of loosely
connected dense agglomerates. Additionally, after a characteristic
anti-thixotropic time $\tau$, a steady flow is reached. This time $\tau$
diverges with increasing shear rate at a critical value corresponding to a
Mason number of one, indicating that anti-thixotropy occurs only when colloidal
attraction outweighs viscous forces. More precisely, we show that the
structural rearrangement underpinning the viscosity decrease is mediated by
elastic stresses $\sigma_e$, such that $\tau \propto \sigma_e^{-3}$. Finally,
on long time scales, the steady state is linked to a microstructure with nearly
zero yield stress, indicating a loss of flow memory. These findings provide a
mechanism for anti-thixotropy and suggest pathways for controlling viscosity
and yield stress in attractive colloidal dispersions.",['cond-mat.soft'],"['Bauland Julien', 'Legrand Gauthier', 'Manneville Sébastien', 'Divoux Thibaut', 'Poulesquen Arnaud', 'Gibaud Thomas']",2025-01-27,,False

instabilities, called resonant drag instabilities. These instabilities have
predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, in which case they are found
to grow fast. Nonlinear simulations indicate that strong dust overdensities can
form, aiding the formation of planetesimals. In reality, however, there is
going to be a distribution of dust sizes, which potentially has important
consequences. We study two different resonant drag instabilities, the streaming
instability and the settling instability, taking into account a continuous
spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether these instabilities survive in
the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the
monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid in an
unstratified shearing box to recover the streaming instability and, for
approximate stratification, the settling instability, in all cases focusing on
small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the
singular perturbation of the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation due
to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the
resonance. The contribution of the resonance to the integral can be negative,
as in the case of the streaming instability, which as a result does not survive
in the polydisperse regime, or positive, which is the case in the settling
instability. The latter therefore has a polydisperse counterpart, with growth
rates that can be comparable to the monodisperse case. Wide size distributions
in almost all cases remove the resonant nature of drag instabilities. This can
lead to reduced growth, as is the case in large parts of parameter space for

heterogeneous embeddings in LLMs. Jenga tackles two key challenges: (1)
minimizing memory fragmentation when managing embeddings of different sizes,
and (2) enabling flexible caching and eviction policies tailored to the
specific token-dependency patterns of various layers. Jenga employs a two-level
memory allocator, leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of embedding sizes
to optimize memory usage and providing APIs to express layer-specific caching
logic to enhance memory reuse.
  We implemente Jenga on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference engine, and
evaluate it with diverse LLMs, datasets, and GPU configurations. Evaluations
show that Jenga improves GPU memory utilization by up to 79.6%, and increases
serving throughput by up to 4.92x (1.80x on average).",['cs.DC'],"['Zhang Chen', 'Du Kuntai', 'Liu Shu', 'Kwon Woosuk', 'Mo Xiangxi', 'Wang Yufeng', 'Liu Xiaoxuan', 'You Kaichao', 'Li Zhuohan', 'Long Mingsheng', 'Zhai Jidong', 'Gonzalez Joseph', 'Stoica Ion']",2025-03-23,,False

human complexity, which may lead to incomplete or flattened representations. To
address this, we introduce SPeCtrum, a grounded framework for constructing
authentic LLM agent personas by incorporating an individual's multidimensional
self-concept. SPeCtrum integrates three core components: Social Identity (S),
Personal Identity (P), and Personal Life Context (C), each contributing
distinct yet interconnected aspects of identity. To evaluate SPeCtrum's
effectiveness in identity representation, we conducted automated and human
evaluations. Automated evaluations using popular drama characters showed that
Personal Life Context (C)-derived from short essays on preferences and daily
routines-modeled characters' identities more effectively than Social Identity
(S) and Personal Identity (P) alone and performed comparably to the full SPC
combination. In contrast, human evaluations involving real-world individuals
found that the full SPC combination provided a more comprehensive self-concept
representation than C alone. Our findings suggest that while C alone may
suffice for basic identity simulation, integrating S, P, and C enhances the
authenticity and accuracy of real-world identity representation. Overall,
SPeCtrum offers a structured approach for simulating individuals in LLM agents,

TestForge thus begins with tests generated via zero-shot prompting, and then

storage and computational requirements of large language models (LLMs) without
additional training cost. Recent PTQ studies have primarily focused on
quantizing only weights to sub-8-bits while maintaining activations at 8-bits
or higher. Accurate sub-8-bit quantization for both weights and activations
without relying on quantization-aware training remains a significant challenge.
We propose a novel quantization method called block clustered quantization
(BCQ) wherein each operand tensor is decomposed into blocks (a block is a group
of contiguous scalars), blocks are clustered based on their statistics, and a
dedicated optimal quantization codebook is designed for each cluster. As a
specific embodiment of this approach, we propose a PTQ algorithm called
Locally-Optimal BCQ (LO-BCQ) that iterates between the steps of block
clustering and codebook design to greedily minimize the quantization mean
squared error. When weight and activation scalars are encoded to W4A4 format

pollutant posing significant risks to human health and the environment in
India. This study, using six years (2018-2024) of daily $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ data,
investigates the seasonal characteristics of the distributions of
$\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentrations across eleven Indian cities, selected from
different regions of the country. We find that, while each city has its own
unique seasonal patterns, all of them show a universal exponential decay in the
tail of the $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distribution for all the seasons. However, the
decay rates of this tail vary across cities, highlighting regional and seasonal
disparities in pollution levels. To quantitatively characterize the {\it
randomness} of the seasonal $\text{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration distributions, we
compute Shannon entropy, a key information theoretic measure. This allows for
classifying cities into different groups, according to the level of randomness
observed in their seasonal distributions. To further explore the inter-city
relationships, we employ Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), a symmetric measure
of relative entropy, to quantitatively assess the degree of similarity in the
$\text{PM}_{2.5}$ distributions among different cities. Remarkably, we find
that several cities show very similar distributions in the winter months, which
helps us to categories them into several groups. The groups obtained from these

Investigating the dust composition and size, and their variation over time, is

located at radial distances of ~22AU and ~34AU, do not have a significant
impact on the dust processing in the inner disk. The flux densities at
wavelengths longer than ~16 micron measured by JWST/MIRI are only ~60% of those

regular undersampling patterns or hand-designed schemes. Recent works have
studied population-adaptive sampling patterns that are learned from a group of

general sampling pattern can be sub-optimal for any specific scan since it may
lack scan or slice adaptive details. To overcome this issue, we propose a
framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns

alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and reconstruction
model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline
optimization of scan-adaptive k-space sampling patterns for each example in the

6.67% was achieved over an 11.8 km fiber link, supporting both power delivery

from 0 W to 2.13 W, the DAS system successfully localized vibration sources and

  Rate-Distortion-Optimized 3DGS Compression","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D
representation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage
requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit
the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application
calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and
entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely
unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned
image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra
correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work,
termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their
rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented
according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to
capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial
autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving
as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to
leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our
CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively
skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact
on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good
rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art
compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets.",['cs.CV'],"['Zhan Yu-Ting', 'Ho Cheng-Yuan', 'Yang Hebi', 'Chen Yi-Hsin', 'Chiang Jui Chiu', 'Liu Yu-Lun', 'Peng Wen-Hsiao']",2025-03-01,,False

  properties","For offshore structures like wind turbines, subsea infrastructure, pipelines,

a proposed site. However, data collection offshore is costly, so analysis of
the seabed sediments must be made from measurements that are spatially sparse.
Adding to this challenge, the structure of the seabed sediments exhibits both
nonstationarity and anisotropy. To address these issues, we propose GeoWarp, a
hierarchical spatial statistical modeling framework for inferring the 3-D
geotechnical properties of subsea sediments. GeoWarp decomposes the seabed
properties into a region-wide vertical mean profile (modeled using B-splines),
and a nonstationary 3-D spatial Gaussian process. Process nonstationarity and
anisotropy are accommodated by warping space in three dimensions and by
allowing the process variance to change with depth. We apply GeoWarp to
measurements of the seabed made using cone penetrometer tests (CPTs) at six
sites on the North West Shelf of Australia. We show that GeoWarp captures the
complex spatial distribution of the sediment properties, and produces realistic
3-D simulations suitable for downstream engineering analyses. Through

one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target
domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical
relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on
discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable
feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate
shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose
a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a

integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained
diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By
incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model
with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark
knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process.
Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through
the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the
generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both
single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method

hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the
X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to
indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole
horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between
X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those
that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous
reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software
package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment
of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to
distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate
variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona.
We fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable

text generation and conduct a diagnostic evaluation, we propose TGEA, an
error-annotated dataset with multiple benchmark tasks for text generation from
pretrained language models (PLMs). We use carefully selected prompt words to
guide GPT-2 to generate candidate sentences, from which we select 47K for error
annotation. Crowdsourced workers manually check each of these sentences and
detect 12k erroneous sentences. We create an error taxonomy to cover 24 types
of errors occurring in these erroneous sentences according to the nature of
errors with respect to linguistics and knowledge (eg, common sense). For each
erroneous span in PLM-generated sentences, we also detect another span that is
closely associated with it. Each error is hence manually labeled with
comprehensive annotations, including the span of the error, the associated
span, minimal correction to the error, the type of the error, and rationale
behind the error. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a
detailed description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis
of the dataset. This is the first dataset with comprehensive annotations for
PLM-generated texts, which facilitates the diagnostic evaluation of PLM-based
text generation. Furthermore, we use TGEA as a benchmark dataset and propose a
series of automatic diagnosis tasks, including error detection, error type
classification, associated span detection, error rationale generation, to
further promote future study on the automatic error detection and correction on

  Evolution of the two first-ranked galaxies","[Abridged] Compact groups (CGs) of galaxies have proven to be unique
environments for studying galaxy interactions. We propose a detailed analysis
of the galaxy evolution to disentangle the relationship between the two
first-ranked galaxies in CGs throughout their history as a function of the
assembly channels of their hosts. Our study was performed from a
semi-analytical point of view, using more than 20000 CGs. We based our analysis
on studying the first- (1R) and second-ranked (2R) galaxies in CGs, where the
ranking is determined using the galaxy stellar mass. The 1R galaxies have
significantly reduced their star-forming capacity over time, reaching a
quenching stage and often becoming bulge-dominated or elliptical. Notably, this
transformation occurred earlier for 1R galaxies in early-formed CGs (around 5
to 8 Gyrs ago), while those in recently-formed CGs experienced this change more
recently (around 2 to 3 Gyrs ago). The analysis of the time evolution of a
variant of the Tremaine & Richstone statistics showed that the 1R galaxy in
early-formed CGs began to stand out for its dominant properties around 6 Gyrs
ago, almost 5 Gyrs earlier than the 1R inhabiting recently formed CGs. We
observed that a large majority of the 1R galaxies have experienced at least one
major merger event during their life, while we observed this only for a third
of 2R galaxies. The 1R galaxies can also display several of these events and
most of their last major merger events can be described as the addition of a
progenitor that is the second most massive galaxy in their surroundings at the
time of the merger. We find that the semi-analytical framework explored in this
work describes a scenario where galaxy mergers are the main driving force in
shaping the properties of the 1R galaxies in CGs. We note that this scenario is

Automated data selection approaches for instruction-tuning are typically tested

hundreds of thousands to millions of samples, subsampled from even larger data

the foundational assumption that these signals provide sufficient entropy

multiple sensors by up to approx. 75% compared to average-case Shannon entropy.
This brings joint min-entropy well below 10 bits in many cases and, in the best
case, yielding only approx. 24 bits of min-entropy when combining 20 sensor

Second, we introduce a subgroup alignment strategy in the place model that

Classical planet formation models tend to produce the former rather than the

Lower $ \lambda $ discs lead to slower formation and migration and more

feeding it into the model, we obtain the posterior distribution of the
dynamical mass profile at ten different radii. Additionally, we evaluate the
performance of existing literature mass estimators on our dataset. Our model
achieves more accurate results than any literature mass estimator while also
providing enclosed mass estimates at radii where no previous estimators exist.
We confirm that the posterior distributions produced by the model are
well-calibrated, ensuring they provide meaningful uncertainties. However,
issues remain, as the method loses performance when trained on one set of
simulations and applied to another, highlighting the importance of improving

2502.01515,"(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper
  Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$","Altermagnets form a subclass of collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split
electronic states. Here, we introduce the Ruddlesden-Popper chromates
Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including the perovskite SrCrO$_3$) as candidates
for antiferromagnetic materials in which altermagnetism emerges from
spontaneous orbital ordering, rather than crystal symmetry. Using
first-principles calculations, we identify a layer-dependent spin splitting of
the electronic states, driven by the interplay between spin and orbital order.
We show that if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the
system exhibits a net spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if
either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe
an anti-altermagnetic state where layerwise compensation leads to net zero spin
splitting. We find that for odd $n$, altermagnetic and anti-altermagnetic
phases can coexist, whereas for even $n$ and in the perovskite limit, the
system remains strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, increasing $n$
favors metallicity. Finally, we indicate that in odd $n$ compounds, epitaxial
strain can promote the altermagnetic phase.",['cond-mat.mtrl-sci'],"['Meier Quintin N.', 'Carta Alberto', 'Ederer Claude', 'Cano Andrés']",2025-02-03,,False

2502.00548,"Violations of the null convergence condition in kinematical transitions
  between singular and regular black holes, horizonless compact objects, and
  bounces","How do regular black holes evade the Penrose singularity theorem? Various
models of stationary regular black holes globally satisfy the null convergence
condition (NCC). At first glance this might seem puzzling, as the NCC must
generically be violated to avoid the focusing point implied by the Penrose
theorem. In fact, the Penrose singularity theorem depends on subtle global
assumptions and does not provide information about where and when the
singularity actually forms. In particular inner horizons are typically reached
at finite affine parameter, before null geodesic focusing occurs, and the
region inside the inner horizon is not itself a trapped region. Specifically,
the Bardeen, Dymnikova, Hayward models of stationary regular black holes
feature an inner Cauchy horizon which violates global hyperbolicity, hence
violating one of the key assumptions of Penrose's singularity theorem, and
furthermore challenging their viability as long-living end-points of
gravitational collapse. In contrast, during non-stationary processes describing
kinematic transitions between standard singular black holes and regular black
holes or horizonless compact objects, the inner horizon -- when present -- need
not act as a Cauchy horizon. This raises the intriguing possibility that the
NCC might instead be violated during intermediate stages of such transitions.
Our detailed analysis confirms that NCC violations occur frequently during such
kinematic transitions, even when the stationary end-point spacetimes respect
the NCC. We also investigate analogous transitions toward black-bounce
spacetimes and their horizonless compact counterparts, wormholes, where the NCC
is always violated. These findings offer new insights into how regular black
holes and related objects evade the constraints imposed by the Penrose
singularity theorem.",['gr-qc'],"['Borissova Johanna', 'Liberati Stefano', 'Visser Matt']",2025-02-01,,False
2501.03057,"Investigating Discontinuous X-ray Irradiation as a Damage Mitigation
  Strategy for [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ Catalysts","With the advent of ever more intense and focused X-ray sources, including in
laboratories, at synchrotrons, and at X-ray free electron lasers,
radiation-induced sample change and damage are becoming increasingly
challenging. Therefore, the exploration of possible mitigation strategies is
crucial to continue to allow the collection of robust and repeatable data. One
mitigation approach is the introduction of short, X-ray-free ``dark'' periods.
However, it is unclear whether this strategy minimises damage or, in actuality,
promotes it through a phenomenon called ``dark progression'', i.e. the increase
or progression of radiation damage that occurs after the X-ray beam is turned
off. This work discusses the influence of introducing dark periods and their
duration on the radiation-induced changes in two model small-molecule
catalysts, [Ir(COD)Cl]$_2$ and [Rh(COD)Cl]$_2$, exposed to X-ray radiation in
powder diffraction (PXRD) and photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments.
This provides, for the first time, insights into how damage progresses under
varying radiation regimes and allows the distinction between the processes that
affect the unit cell itself, the individual molecular units, and the respective
atomic chemical environments. Furthermore, it provides the basis for informed
decision-making in the design of future experiments where the need to minimise

2503.18135,"MLLM-For3D: Adapting Multimodal Large Language Model for 3D Reasoning
  Segmentation","Reasoning segmentation aims to segment target objects in complex scenes based
on human intent and spatial reasoning. While recent multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation,
adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers
knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize
MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text
embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text
embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial
consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects
that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D
model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address
this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation
masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of
the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal
semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object
across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor
scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data,
MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively
interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial

leveraging decaying sensitivity in both discrete and continuous time. Results

imitate annotated responses for given instructions. In this paper, we challenge
this paradigm and propose Critique Fine-Tuning (CFT), a strategy where models
learn to critique noisy responses rather than simply imitate correct ones.
Inspired by human learning processes that emphasize critical thinking, CFT
encourages deeper analysis and nuanced understanding-traits often overlooked by
standard SFT. To validate the effectiveness of CFT, we construct a 50K-sample
dataset from WebInstruct, using GPT-4o as the teacher to generate critiques in
the form of ([query; noisy response], critique). CFT on this dataset yields a
consistent 4-10% improvement over SFT on six math benchmarks with different
base models like Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Math and DeepSeek-Math. We further expand to
MetaMath and NuminaMath datasets and observe similar gains over SFT. Notably,
our model Qwen2.5-Math-CFT only requires 1 hour training on 8xH100 over the 50K
examples. It can match or outperform strong competitors like
Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct on most benchmarks, which use over 2M samples. Moreover,
it can match the performance of SimpleRL, which is a deepseek-r1 replication
trained with 140x more compute. Ablation studies show that CFT is robust to the

devices of various lateral dimensions patterned side-by-side on epitaxial
PdCoO$_2$ thin films. We study the effects of both the thickness of the
PdCoO$_2$ film and the width of the channel on the electronic transport and the
magnetoresistance properties of the Hall bar devices. All the films with
thicknesses down to 4.88 nm are epitaxially oriented, phase pure, and exhibit a
metallic behavior. At room temperature, the Hall bar device with the channel
width $\text{W}=2.5\, \mu\text{m}$ exhibits a record resistivity value of
$0.85\,\mu\Omega$cm, while the value of $2.70\,\mu\Omega$cm is obtained in a
wider device with channel width $\text{W}=10\, \mu\text{m}$. For the 4.88 nm
thick sample, we find that while the density of the conduction electrons is
comparable in both channels, the electrons move about twice as fast in the
narrower channel. At low temperatures, for Hall bar devices of channel width
$2.5\,\mu\text{m}$ fabricated on epitaxial films of thicknesses 4.88 and 5.21

temperature dependent and exhibit a dependency with the orientation of the
applied magnetic field. When the applied field is oriented 90{\deg} away from

2503.10259,"KVQ: Boosting Video Quality Assessment via Saliency-guided Local
  Perception","Video Quality Assessment (VQA), which intends to predict the perceptual
quality of videos, has attracted increasing attention. Due to factors like
motion blur or specific distortions, the quality of different regions in a
video varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is
beneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting
fine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of
annotating region-wise quality, the lack of ground truth constraints from
relevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception.
Inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the
local texture of different regions and their visual saliency, we propose a
Kaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework, which aims to
effectively assess both saliency and local texture, thereby facilitating the
assessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and
allocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a
Local Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture
perception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across
multiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods.
Furthermore, to assess local perception, we establish a new Local Perception

results demonstrate the capability of KVQ in perceiving local distortions. KVQ

reviewing an existing prototype. Then, the fundamentals of PASS are introduced,
including their physical principles, signal models, and communication designs.
In contrast to existing multi-antenna systems, PASS brings a novel concept,
termed \emph{Pinching Beamforming}, which is achieved by dynamically adjusting
the positions of pinching antennas (PAs). Based on this concept, a couple of
practical transmission architectures are proposed for realizing the full
potentia of PASS, namely non-multiplexing and multiplexing architectures. More
particularly, 1) the non-multiplexing architecture is featured by simple
baseband signal processing and relies on the pinching beamforming only; while
2) the multiplexing architecture provides enhanced signal processing
capabilities with joint baseband and pinching beamforming, which can be further
divided into sub-connected, fully-connected, and phase-shifter-based
fully-connected schemes. Furthermore, several emerging scenarios are put
forward for integrating PASS into future wireless networks. As a further

  sequences for identification of monomer contributions to properties","The properties of biological materials like proteins and nucleic acids are
largely determined by their primary sequence. While certain segments in the
sequence strongly influence specific functions, identifying these segments, or
so-called motifs, is challenging due to the complexity of sequential data.
While deep learning (DL) models can accurately capture sequence-property
relationships, the degree of nonlinearity in these models limits the assessment
of monomer contributions to a property - a critical step in identifying key
motifs. Recent advances in explainable AI (XAI) offer attention and
gradient-based methods for estimating monomeric contributions. However, these

identification, where they achieve limited accuracy (40-45%) and rely on
qualitative evaluations. To address these limitations, we introduce a DL model
with interpretable steps, enabling direct tracing of monomeric contributions.
We also propose a metric ($\mathcal{I}$), inspired by the masking technique in
the field of image analysis and natural language processing, for quantitative
analysis on datasets mainly containing distinct properties of anti-cancer
peptides (ACP), antimicrobial peptides (AMP), and collagen. Our model exhibits
22% higher explainability, pinpoints critical motifs (RRR, RRI, and RSS) that

2503.06448,A Novel Design for SRAM Bitcell with 3-Complementary-FETs,"The complementary field-effect transistors (CFETs), featuring vertically
stacked n/p-FETs, enhance integration density and significantly reduce the area
of standard cells such as static random-access memory (SRAM). However, the
advantage of area scaling through CFETs is hindered by the imbalance in N/P
transistor counts (typically 4N/2P) within SRAM cells. In this work, we propose
a novel 6T-SRAM design using three sets of CFETs, achieved by vertically
stacking two n-FET pass-gate (PG) transistors via the CFET architecture.
Through TCAD simulations, we optimize channel doping concentration and the
number of top/bottom nanosheets (NS), demonstrating that junctionless
accumulation mode (JAM) devices outperform inversion mode (IM) devices for PG
and pull-down (PD) transistors. The proposed design achieves a 37% area
reduction in SRAM standard cell layout compared to conventional CFET-based
SRAM. With optimized parameters (n-type doping of \(1\times10^{15}\)

  Array Technology also Benefit Wireless Communication?","For the 6G wireless networks, achieving high-performance integrated
localization and communication (ILAC) is critical to unlock the full potential
of wireless networks. To simultaneously enhance localization and communication
performance cost-effectively, this paper proposes sparse multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) based ILAC with nested and co-prime sparse arrays
deployed at the base station. Sparse MIMO relaxes the traditional
half-wavelength antenna spacing constraint to enlarge the antenna aperture,
thus enhancing localization degrees of freedom and providing finer spatial
resolution. However, it also leads to undesired grating lobes, which may cause
severe inter-user interference for communication and angular ambiguity for
localization. While the latter issue can be effectively addressed by the
virtual array technology, by forming sum or difference co-arrays via signal
(conjugate) correlation among array elements, it is unclear whether the similar
virtual array technology also benefits wireless communications for ILAC
systems. In this paper, we first reveal that the answer to the above question
is negative, by showing that forming virtual arrays for wireless communication
will cause destruction of phase information, degradation of signal-to-noise
ratio and aggravation of multi-user interference. Therefore, we propose the
hybrid processing for sparse MIMO based ILAC, i.e., physical array based
communication while virtual array based localization. To this end, we
characterize the beam pattern of sparse arrays by three metrics, demonstrating
that despite of the introduction of grating lobes, sparse arrays can also bring
benefits to communications thanks to its narrower main lobe beam width than the
conventional compact arrays. Extensive simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the performance gains of sparse MIMO based ILAC over that based on

  Classification","Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to train a model on seen classes and recognize
unseen classes by knowledge transfer through shared auxiliary information.
Recent studies reveal that documents from encyclopedias provide helpful
auxiliary information. However, existing methods align noisy documents,
entangled in visual and non-visual descriptions, with image regions, yet solely
depend on implicit learning. These models fail to filter non-visual noise
reliably and incorrectly align non-visual words to image regions, which is
harmful to knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attribute
document supervision framework to remove noises at both document collection and
model learning stages. With the help of large language models, we introduce a
novel prompt algorithm that automatically removes non-visual descriptions and
enriches less-described documents in multiple attribute views. Our proposed
model, MADS, extracts multi-view transferable knowledge with information
decoupling and semantic interactions for semantic alignment at local and global
levels. Besides, we introduce a model-agnostic focus loss to explicitly enhance
attention to visually discriminative information during training, also
improving existing methods without additional parameters. With comparable

intriguing relationship between solution accuracy (Pass@10) and response
diversity, we propose DivSampling -- a novel and versatile sampling technique
designed to enhance the diversity of candidate solutions by introducing prompt

task-agnostic approaches, which are general and not tailored to any specific
task, and task-specific approaches, which are customized based on task content.
Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild assumptions, the error
rates of responses generated from diverse prompts are significantly lower

the scattering interaction arising from disparate scales - e.g., with
nonperturbative matrix elements associated with long distances and a
perturbative hard scattering kernel applying to short-distance parton-level
interactions. The fundamental underpinnings of factorization may be recast in
the quantum-theoretic terms of entanglement, (de)coherence, and system
localization in a fashion which sheds complementary light on the dynamics at
work in DIS from QCD bound states. In this Letter, we propose and
quantitatively test such a quantum-information theoretic approach for
dissecting factorization in DIS and its domain of validity; we employ metrics
associated with quantum entanglement such as a differential quantum entropy and
associated KL divergences in numerical tests. We deploy these methods on an
archetypal quark-spectator model of the proton, for which we monitor quantum
decoherence in DIS as underlying model parameters are varied. On this basis, we
demonstrate quantitatively how factorization-breaking effects may be imprinted

2502.07372,"USRNet: Unified Scene Recovery Network for Enhancing Traffic Imaging
  under Multiple Adverse Weather Conditions","Advancements in computer vision technology have facilitated the extensive
deployment of intelligent transportation systems and visual surveillance
systems across various applications, including autonomous driving, public
safety, and environmental monitoring. However, adverse weather conditions such
as haze, rain, snow, and more complex mixed degradation can significantly
degrade image quality. The degradation compromises the accuracy and reliability
of these systems across various scenarios. To tackle the challenge of
developing adaptable models for scene restoration, we introduce the unified
scene recovery network (USRNet), capable of handling multiple types of image
degradation. The USRNet features a sophisticated architecture consisting of a
scene encoder, an attention-driven node independent learning mechanism (NILM),
an edge decoder, and a scene restoration module. The scene encoder, powered by
advanced residual blocks, extracts deep features from degraded images in a
progressive manner, ensuring thorough encoding of degradation information. To
enhance the USRNet's adaptability in diverse weather conditions, we introduce
NILM, which enables the network to learn and respond to different scenarios
with precision, thereby increasing its robustness. The edge decoder is designed
to extract edge features with precision, which is essential for maintaining
image sharpness. Experimental results demonstrate that USRNet surpasses
existing methods in handling complex imaging degradations, thereby improving
the accuracy and reliability of visual systems across diverse scenarios. The

at approximately 7.1 years, followed by a gradual decline into adulthood. Sex
differences were evident, with distinct regional maturation patterns rather
than uniform differences across all brain regions. Beyond normative modeling,
we quantified individual deviations from expected CBF patterns in
neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, identifying disease-specific
perfusion abnormalities across four brain disorders. Using longitudinal data,
we established typical and atypical cerebral perfusion trajectories,

significant evolution in $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ relative to local scaling
relationships both in low-mass galaxies and in quasars at z $\ge$ 4. We test
this possibility by (1) determining the preferred $M_\bullet/M_{*}$ scaling
relation among those proposed locally; and (2) providing uniform host galaxy
stellar mass estimates. These steps reduce the prominence of the reported

biases. We still find a significant increase over the local scaling relation in
$M_\bullet/M_{*}$ for z $\ge$ 4 SMBHs in very low-mass galaxies

addition, existing deep models learn features in Euclidean space, where PolSAR

the complex covariance matrix is Hermitian positive definite (HPD), and resides

expanding in the ISM of a simulated isolated disk galaxy. The ISM of the galaxy
is resolved down to a maximum resolution of $\sim 12\,\text{pc}$, while we
achieve a zoomed-in resolution of $\sim 0.18\, \text{pc}$ in the vicinity of
the explosion sources. We compute the time-evolution of the SNRs' geometry and
compare it to the observed geometry of the Local Bubble. Results. During the
early stages of evolution, SNRs are well described by existing analytical
models. On longer timescales, starting at about a percent of the orbital
timescale, they depart from spherical symmetry and become increasingly prolate
or oblate. The timescale for the departure from spherical symmetry is shorter
than the expectation from a simple model for the deformation by galactic shear,
suggesting that galactic shear alone cannot explain these differences. Yet, the
alignment of the minor- and major axis of the SNRs is in line with expectations
from said model, indicating that the deformation might have a shear-related
origin. A comparison with the geometry of the Local Bubble reveals that it
might be slightly younger than previously believed, but otherwise has a
standard morphology for a SNR of its age and size. Conclusions. Studying the

non-Abelian topological transitions have been investigated in Hermitian

this transition, we successfully characterized such a transition with the
measurement of the complex eigenvalue braids. We obtained the braid invariants
from the measured relative phases between eigenvalues. The observed change in
braid invariants provides a clear signature of the non-Abelian topological
transition. Furthermore, we experimentally revealed an intriguing consequence
of this transition, which is the creation of a third-order exceptional point
through the collision of two second-order exceptional points with opposite
charges. Our experimental findings shed light on the abundant non-Abelian

resolution observations at cm wavelengths. The synchrotron nature of the radio
emission confirms its particle accelerator status. According to astrometric
measurements since 1996, the system has an orbital period of ~120 yr and
recently went through its periastron passage. We characterize the radio
emission during the epoch of periastron passage, when the particle density and
the local magnetic energy density in the CWR increase. We monitored HD93129A

from 2003 to 2018, with the caveat that the 2009-2018 time lapse is devoid of
data, and a similar decay between 2018 to 2020. We fit the spectral energy
distribution of quasi-simultaneous data at three epochs and find that the
magnetic-to-thermal pressure ratio does not remain constant along the orbit,
possible suggesting magnetic field amplification close to periastron. In the
2019 epoch, we estimate a magnetic field strength of ~1.1G in the apex of the
CWR. The evolution of the SED and spectral index is also presented. By
combining ATCA and ASKAP images a spectral index map was obtained in an area of

effectively captures the entire distribution of these random objects.
Remarkably, it operates with minimal tuning parameters, requiring only the
specification of cut-off intervals near endpoints, where change points are
assumed not to occur. Our theoretical contributions include deriving the
asymptotic distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis of no
change points, establishing the consistency of the test in the presence of

and quantify the origin of gas that ultimately forms the in situ stars of
galaxies. We tracked back the baryonic mass contributing to the $z=0$ in situ
stellar populations of galaxies, studying trends in mass from dwarfs to
group-scale halos. We find that more massive halos acquire this matter earlier
than lower-mass halos, reflecting an overall earlier assembly of their in situ
stellar mass. Defining the Lagrangian half-mass radius R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ of a
galaxy as the distance containing half of the mass that will form its in situ
stars by $z=0$, we find that R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ is larger for more massive halos
at early times, reflecting larger ""in situ Lagrangian regions."" However, the
dependence of this radius on halo mass becomes flat at $z \simeq 3$ and then
inverts toward $z=0$. In addition, R$_{\rm L, 1/2}$ increases rapidly with
redshift, surpassing the virial radii of halos at $z \sim 2$. This marks the
cosmic epoch at which most of the gas that eventually forms the in situ stars
of galaxies leaves the intergalactic medium (IGM) and enters halos, a
transition that occurs earlier for more massive halos. The formation redshift
of the in situ stellar component increases with halo mass, while the formation
redshift of the dark matter halo decreases, indicative of a differential
assembly history between these two components. Finally, we decomposed the $z=0$

accounts for the presence of a finite group action on $\#^n(S^1\times S^2)$.
Our proof is independent of the classical theorem, so by considering the

  Specifically, we show that any finite group action on $\#^n(S^1\times S^2)$
extends to a $\textit{linearly parted}$ action on $\natural^n(S^1\times B^3)$

acts linearly on that handle. The restriction to linearly parted actions is
important, because there are infinitely many distinct nonlinear actions on
$B^4$ with identical actions on $\partial B^4$; these nonlinear actions give
extensions of the same action on $\partial B^4$ which are $\textit{not}$

Poly-LSM is embedded with a new design of graph-oriented LSM-tree structure
that features a hybrid storage model for concisely and effectively storing

insertions and deletions on graphs with optimized I/O efficiency. (3) Poly-LSM

response to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion
system tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp
exploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals,
which causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the
precise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar
images of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep
neural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth
completion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless,
training FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image

segregated with little interactions, blocking vast opportunities of
cross-fertilization to explore. Here we unify both concepts into a novel
framework of coherent control for light interacting with open photonic systems.
From the QNM perspective, scattered waves are superimposed radiations from all
QNMs excited, and thus coherent controls can be mapped into another problem of
QNM excitation manipulations. Within our framework, all incident properties
(amplitudes, phases and polarizations) of waves from different directions can
be exploited simultaneously in a synchronous manner, facilitating independent
manipulations of each QNM and thus unlocking enormous flexibilities for
coherent controls of both scattering intensity and polarization: (i) A visible
structure under a single incident wave can be made invisible through shining
extra waves; (ii) Along a direction where QNMs' radiation polarizations are
identical, scattering along this direction can be fully eliminated, thus
generalizing Kerker effects from a distinct QNM perspective; (iii) Along a

polarizations can be obtained. Given the ubiquity and profundity of QNMs and

limited sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using the existing
mechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve
significant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field.
The recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange
interaction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable
signal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between
the biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the
current JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron
polarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is
associated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power
microwave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization
imbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here,
we propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced
singlet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet
excitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet
cross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead
to the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This

sparsifies the LoRA outcomes based on the corresponding sparse weights during
fine-tuning, thus guaranteeing that the LoRA module can be integrated into the
sparse LLMs post-training. Besides, LoSA leverages Representation Mutual
Information (RMI) as an indicator to determine the importance of layers,
thereby efficiently determining the layer-wise sparsity rates during
fine-tuning. Predicated on this, LoSA adjusts the rank of the LoRA module based
on the variability in layer-wise reconstruction errors, allocating an
appropriate fine-tuning for each layer to reduce the output discrepancies

established method to compare them. OBJECTIVE. We aim to establish a method to
compare ""real"" attack trees, based on both the structure of the tree itself and
the meaning of the node labels. METHOD. We define four methods of comparison
(three novel and one established) and compare them to a dataset of attack trees
created from a study run on students (n = 39). These attack trees all follow
from the same scenario, but have slightly different labels. RESULTS. We find
that applying semantic similarity as a means of comparing node labels is a
valid approach. Further, we find that treeedit distance (established) and
radical distance (novel) are themost promising methods of comparison in most
circumstances. CONCLUSION. We show that these two methods are valid as means of
comparing attack trees, and suggest a novel technique for using semantic
similarity to compare node labels. We further suggest that these methods can be
used to compare attack trees in a real-world scenario, and that they can be
used to identify similar attack trees.",['cs.CR'],"['Schiele Nathan D.', 'Gadyatskaya Olga']",2025-03-04,,False

mapping regression for camera re-localization. Previous methods typically rely
on feature matching (FM) with stored descriptors or use a single network to
encode both points and lines. While FM-based methods perform well in
large-scale environments, they become computationally expensive with a growing
number of mapping points and lines. Conversely, approaches that learn to encode
mapping features within a single network reduce memory footprint but are prone
to overfitting, as they may capture unnecessary correlations between points and
lines. We propose that these features should be learned independently, each
with a distinct focus, to achieve optimal accuracy. To this end, we introduce a
new architecture that learns to prioritize each feature independently before
combining them for localization. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly enhances the 3D map point and line regression

chest CT reports, with a focus on tokenization efficiency, processing time, and
classification performance. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using
the CT-RATE-JPN dataset containing 22,778 training reports and 150 test

common chest CT conditions. The training data was split in 18,222:4,556 for
training and validation. Performance was evaluated using F1 scores for each
condition and exact match accuracy across all 18 labels. Results: ModernBERT
demonstrated superior tokenization efficiency, requiring 24.0% fewer tokens per
document (258.1 vs. 339.6) compared to BERT Base. This translated to
significant performance improvements, with ModernBERT completing training in
1877.67 seconds versus BERT's 3090.54 seconds (39% reduction). ModernBERT
processed 38.82 samples per second during training (1.65x faster) and 139.90

data-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this
work, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to
reconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators
for fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging
gradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our
approach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of
cosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on

near scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at

However, such metrics tend to underestimate reviews that articulate the

unparalleled vapor transport efficiency. The 1-adamantanamine promotes
transport and enhances the affinity to the VOC, ensuring excellent membrane
performance at different applications of the MD process. Transport was enhanced

  Systems with Imperfect CSI","This paper investigates a two-timescale uplink transmission framework for a
fluid antenna-enabled multiuser multi-input multi-output system (MIMO-FAS).
Antenna positions are optimized based on statistical channel state information
(CSI), while beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) adapt to
instantaneous CSI. Under a Rician fading channel with imperfect CSI, we
establish a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation
approach and derive a closed-form expression for the achievable uplink rate
using a low-complexity maximal-ratio-combining (MRC) detector. The optimization
problem is formulated as a minimum user rate maximization problem by optimizing
the fluid antenna positions, subject to the feasible region and the minimum
spacing distance constraints. To address this non-convex problem, a genetic
algorithm (GA) method is proposed, encoding antenna configurations as
population individuals. Additionally, an accelerated gradient ascent algorithm
is proposed to enhance computational efficiency. Numerical results validate the

affects whether certain units are observed. It is a common pitfall in
longitudinal studies, particularly in settings where treatment assignment is
confounded. In this paper, I highlight the drawbacks of one of the most popular
identification strategies in such settings: Difference-in-Differences (DiD).
Specifically, I employ principal stratification analysis to show that the
conventional ATT estimand may not be well defined, and the DiD estimand cannot
be interpreted causally without additional assumptions. To address these
issues, I develop an identification strategy to partially identify causal
effects on the subset of units with well-defined and observed outcomes under
both treatment regimes. I adapt Lee bounds to the Changes-in-Changes (CiC)
setting (Athey & Imbens, 2006), leveraging the time dimension of the data to
relax the unconfoundedness assumption in the original trimming strategy of Lee
(2009). This setting has the DiD identification strategy as a particular case,
which I also implement in the paper. Additionally, I explore how to leverage
multiple sources of sample selection to relax the monotonicity assumption in
Lee (2009), which may be of independent interest. Alongside the identification
strategy, I present estimators and inference results. I illustrate the

primary indications that a system may not be performing as expected. Once
alerts are triggered, Site Reliability Engineers delve into detailed data
across various modalities such as metrics, logs, and traces - to diagnose
system issues. However, defining an optimal set of alerts is increasingly
challenging due to the sheer volume of multi-modal observability data points in
large cloud-native systems. Typically, alerts are manually curated, primarily
defined on the metrics modality, and heavily reliant on subject matter experts
manually navigating through the large state-space of intricate relationships in
multi-modal observability data. Such a process renders defining alerts prone to
insufficient coverage, potentially missing critical events. Defining alerts is
even more challenging with the shift from traditional monolithic architectures
to microservice based architectures due to the intricate interplay between
microservices governed by the application topology in an ever stochastic
environment. To tackle this issue, we take a data driven approach wherein we
propose KIMetrix, a system that relies only on historical metric data and
lightweight microservice traces to identify microservice metric criticality.
KIMetrix significantly aids Subject Matter Experts by identifying a critical
set of metrics to define alerts, averting the necessity of weaving through the
vast multi-modal observability sphere. KIMetrix delves deep into the

emerged as a key resource for quantum computational advantage in multiple
settings. Many such results hinge specifically on contextuality witnessed
through Pauli measurements. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of
(state-dependent) Pauli contextuality, focusing on cycle measurement scenarios,
the simplest scenarios capable of exhibiting contextual behaviour. First, we
study realizability of cycle scenarios with multi-qubit Pauli observables: we
show that the maximum size of a cycle faithfully realizable by $m$-qubit Paulis
is upper bounded by $3m$, while we construct explicit realizations of cycles of
size $2m-1$ or $2m$, depending on whether $m \not\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ or $m
\equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. Then, we investigate the presence of contextuality: we
prove that no $n$-cycle Pauli realization for $n > 4$ can witness contextuality
(on any quantum state), whereas for $n = 4$ every Pauli realization exhibits
contextuality, attaining the quantum bound for all noncontextuality
inequalities on some pure state. Finally, we discuss arbitrary Pauli scenarios
in light of Vorob'ev's theorem, and show that, contrary to what our cycle
characterization might suggest, the presence of $4$-cycles is not necessary for
witnessing contextuality in general Pauli scenarios.",['quant-ph'],"['Choudhary Raman', 'Barbosa Rui Soares']",2025-02-05,,False

  Indoor Localization","Various deep learning models have been developed for indoor localization
based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, they often
require adaptation to ensure accurate tracking in new target operational
domains. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
methods have been proposed to align pre-trained models with data from target
environments. However, they rely on large annotated datasets from the initial
domain (source). Source data access is limited by privacy, storage,
computational, and transfer constraints. Although many source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods address these constraints in classification, applying
them to regression models for localization remains challenging. Indeed, target
datasets for indoor localization are typically small, with few features and
samples, and are noisy. Adapting regression models requires high-confidence
target pseudo-annotation to avoid over-training. In this paper, a specialized
mean-teacher method called MTLoc is proposed for SFDA. MTLoc updates the
student network using noisy data and teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The
teacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To
further ensure robustness, the teacher's pseudo-labels are refined using
k-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on
target data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor

  Energy Consumption: An Experimental Study on Trade-Offs","Context: Microservice-based systems have established themselves in the
software industry. However, sustainability-related legislation and the growing
costs of energy-hungry software increase the importance of energy efficiency
for these systems. While some proposals for architectural tactics and patterns
exist, their effectiveness as well as potential trade-offs on other quality
attributes (QAs) remain unclear.
  Goal: We therefore aim to study the effectiveness of microservices tactics
and patterns to reduce energy consumption, as well as potential trade-offs with
performance and maintainability.
  Method: Using the open-source Online Boutique system, we conducted a
controlled experiment with three tactics and three patterns, and analyzed the
impact of each technique compared to a baseline. We also tested with three
levels of simulated request loads (low, medium, high).
  Results: Request load moderated the effectiveness of reducing energy
consumption. All techniques (tactics and patterns) reduced the energy
consumption for at least one load level, up to 5.6%. For performance, the
techniques could negatively impact response time by increasing it by up to
25.9%, while some also decreased it by up to 72.5%. Two techniques increased
the throughput, by 1.9% and 34.0%. For maintainability, three techniques had a
negative, one a positive, and two no impact.
  Conclusion: Some techniques reduced energy consumption while also improving
performance. However, these techniques usually involved a trade-off in
maintainability, e.g., via more code duplication and module coupling. Overall,
all techniques significantly reduced energy consumption at higher loads, but
most of them sacrificed one of the other QAs. This highlights that the real

field of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to
learn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For
low-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the
scarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the
models' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation
performance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a
quest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an
empirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for
boosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic
fine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data;
(ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the
LLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot
examples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a
pre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and
low-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages
(R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our
findings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs,
possibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their
limited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models,
in-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and
cheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently,
very large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages

Moreover, this exercise produces new ``magic identities"", {\it i.e.} certain

identities up to six loops explicitly.
  On the other hand, most of these individual integrals have not been computed
beyond three loops, and as a first step we consider a bootstrap program for DCI
integrals based on their leading singularities and the space of pure functions.
We bootstrap the $3$ non-trivial DCI integrals for four-loop Coulomb branch
amplitudes (providing an independent verification of the four-loop magic
identity), which all take remarkably simple form as weight-$8$ single-valued
harmonic polylogarithms. We also compute all leading singularities and a large

fantasy worlds, with images serving as the primary medium for visually
experiencing these realms. Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning
with theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image

specific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such
as characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key
challenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and
continuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often
come with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of
overfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation
models directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large
language models use text as context? To address this, we present T-Prompter, a
novel training-free TSI method for generation. T-Prompter introduces visual
prompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models,
allowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring
additional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic

improve the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables
diverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design,
realistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative

of its kagome lattice with external pressure. The breathing distortion is
suppressed around 15 GPa and reversed at higher pressures. These changes lead
to a series of Lifshitz transitions that we detect using broadband and

consistency, reliability, and fault tolerance. Traditional Crash Fault Tolerant
(CFT) protocols, which assume a fail-stop model, are inadequate for untrusted
cloud environments where adversaries or software bugs can cause Byzantine
behavior. Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols address these threats but
face significant performance, resource overheads, and scalability challenges.
This paper introduces Recipe, a novel approach to transforming CFT protocols to
operate securely in Byzantine settings without altering their core logic.
Recipe rethinks CFT protocols in the context of modern cloud hardware,
including many-core servers, RDMA-capable networks, and Trusted Execution
Environments (TEEs). The approach leverages these advancements to enhance the
security and performance of replication protocols in untrusted cloud
environments. Recipe implements two practical security mechanisms, i.e.,
transferable authentication and non-equivocation, using TEEs and
high-performance networking stacks (e.g., RDMA, DPDK). These mechanisms ensure
that any CFT protocol can be transformed into a BFT protocol, guaranteeing
authenticity and non-equivocation. The Recipe protocol consists of five key
components: transferable authentication, initialization, normal operation, view
change, and recovery phases. The protocol's correctness is formally verified
using Tamarin, a symbolic model checker. Recipe is implemented as a library and
applied to transform four widely used CFT protocols-Raft, Chain Replication,
ABD, and AllConcur-into Byzantine settings. The results demonstrate up to 24x
higher throughput compared to PBFT and 5.9x better performance than

from a precise mechanistic ""super model"" to simpler conceptual models using
Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions, an algebraic approach to singular perturbation

scale separations (Tikhonov's theorem, quasi-steady state assumption),
Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions have the advantage that we can compute a reduction
directly for a separation of rates into slow and fast ones instead of a
separation of components of the system. Moreover, we can find all such
reductions algorithmically.
  In the present paper we use Tikhonov-Fenichel reductions to analyse a
mutualism model tailored towards lichens with an explicit description of the
interaction. We find that (1) the implicit description of the interaction given
in the reductions by interaction terms (functional responses) varies depending
on the scenario, (2) there is a tendency for the mycobiont, an obligate
mutualist, to always benefit from the interaction while it can be detrimental
for the photobiont, a facultative mutualist, depending on the parameters, (3)
our model is capable of describing the shift from mutualism to parasitism, (4)

crucial in managing ecosystems under major environmental changes. Multiple
biodiversity drivers can stabilize ecosystem functions over time. However, we
know little about how local environmental conditions can influence these
biodiversity drivers, and consequently how they indirectly shape the ecological
stability of ecosystems.
  2. We hypothesized that environmental factors can have opposite influences
(i.e., not necessarily either positive or negative) on the temporal stability
of communities in different environmental ranges depending on the biodiversity
drivers involved. We tested this novel hypothesis by using data from a

dominant species) generally increased the temporal stability of aquatic primary
producers. However, the effect of water depth either increased or decreased the
stability of biomass according to the environmental conditions associated with

significantly related to the rules of punctuation. In particular, the distances

However, the values of two parameters marking specific forms of these
distributions distinguish specific languages. This is such a strong constraint
that the punctuation distributions of texts translated from the original
language into another adopt quantitative characteristics of the target
language. All these changes take place within Weibull distributions such that
the corresponding hazard functions are always increasing. Recent previous
research shows that James Joyce's famous ""Finnegans Wake"" is subject to such
extreme distribution from the Weibull family that the corresponding hazard
function is clearly decreasing. At the same time, the distances of sentence
ending punctuation marks, determining the variability of sentence length, have
an almost perfect multifractal organization, so far to such an extent found
nowhere else in the literature. In the present contribution based on several

  Reproduction","Automated bug reproduction is a challenging task, with existing tools

reports as input. However, images provided in bug reports have been overlooked.
To address this gap, this paper presents an empirical study investigating the
necessity of including images as part of the input in automated bug
reproduction. We examined the characteristics and patterns of images in bug
reports, focusing on (1) the distribution and types of images (e.g., UI

accompanying text, annotations), and (3) the functional roles they served,
particularly their contribution to reproducing bugs. Furthermore, we analyzed
the impact of images on the performance of existing tools, identifying the
reasons behind their influence and the ways in which they can be leveraged to
improve bug reproduction. Our findings reveal several key insights that
demonstrate the importance of images in supporting automated bug reproduction.
Specifically, we identified six distinct functional roles that images serve in

algorithm (IBPG) for minimizing the sum of two single-valued functions in
finite dimension. We suppose that one of the functions is proper, closed, and
convex but non-necessarily smooth whilst the second is a smooth enough function
but not necessarily convex. For the latter, we ask the smooth adaptable
property (smad) with respect to some kernel or entropy which allows to remove
the very popular global Lipschitz continuity requirement on the gradient of the
smooth part. We consider the IBPG under the framework of the triangle scaling
property (TSP) which is a geometrical property for which one can provably
ensure acceleration for a certain subset of kernel/entropy functions in the
convex setting. Based on this property, we provide global convergence
guarantees when the entropy is strongly convex under the framework of the

  Linear-Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions with Bias Field","The major goal of quantum metrology (QM) is to exploit the quantum resources
to raise the measurement precision (MP) as high as possible. When the quantum
resources such as squeezing has been widely explored, light-mater interaction
systems set up a highly controllable platform applicable for QM in novel
pursuit of high MP. However, critical QM by the conventional linear interaction
is confronted with the restriction of low-frequency-limit condition and the
detrimental problem of diverging preparation time of the probe state (PTPS).
This work shows that mixed interactions by linear and nonlinear light-matter
couplings in the presence of bias field can provide various quantum resources,
including squeezing, degeneracy lifting, displacement and quantum phase
transition. These resources manifest high sensitivity for QM as demonstrated by
analytically obtained critical components or exponential behavior of quantum
Fisher information. We find that these sensitivity resources can be combined to
upgrade the upper bound of MP by many orders over the widely-applied squeezing
resource. As further advantages, such an upgraded metrology protocol not only
breaks the frequency-limit restrictions but also avoids the detrimental problem
of diverging PTPS which were both encountered in linear interaction. Our work

  Framework for Multi-Layered Parameter Space Pruning","Context-aware compression techniques have gained increasing attention as
model sizes continue to grow, introducing computational bottlenecks that hinder
efficient deployment. A structured encoding approach was proposed to
selectively eliminate redundant parameter groups while ensuring that
representational fidelity was preserved across multiple layers. Contextual
Compression Encoding (CCE) introduced a multi-stage encoding mechanism that
dynamically restructured parameter distributions, allowing for significant
reductions in memory footprint and computational complexity. Experimental
evaluations demonstrated that models compressed through CCE retained linguistic
expressivity and coherence, maintaining accuracy across a range of text
generation and classification tasks. Layer-wise analysis revealed that
middle-network layers exhibited higher compression ratios, aligning with the
observation that self-attention and feed-forward transformations contained
redundancies that could be reorganized without impairing functional capacity.
Comparisons against conventional quantization and pruning methods confirmed
that CCE provided a more balanced trade-off between efficiency and model
retention, achieving reductions in energy consumption and inference latency
without requiring extensive retraining. Computational efficiency improvements
were particularly evident in deployment scenarios involving
resource-constrained environments, where reductions in memory usage enabled
more scalable implementations. Further analyses of internal network behavior

as they provide a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of
mixtures. This work delivers a broad and systematic overview of possible
ternary phase diagrams for amorphous systems representative of polymers, small
organic molecules, and solvents. Thanks to computationally efficient methods,
an unprecedented library of $>$80,000 ternary phase diagrams is generated based
on a systematic screening of interaction parameters. Twenty-one phase diagram
types, including unreported ones, are identified. They are classified according
to simple rules related to the number of immiscible material pairs, of
miscibility gaps, and of three-phase regions. They are mapped onto the
three-dimensional interaction parameters space, providing a clear picture of
their likelihood and existence conditions. Four well-known phase-diagram types
with 0, 1, 2, or 3 immiscible pairs are found to be the most likely. The
numerous uncommon phase diagrams are mostly observed within a small parameter
window around the critical interaction parameter values. For the most common
phase diagram types, we show that the size of the processability window becomes
sensitive to interaction parameter variations close to critical values. The
sensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally,
successful comparisons of simulated and experimental phase diagrams showcase
the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis. The presented results

to other well-know Type Ib supernovae. We analyzed its multi-wavelength light
curve, which exhibited a possible period modulation that could result from a
geometrical effect. Methods. We analyzed the modulation present at all
available bands in SN 2015ap's light curves using a Bayesian approach for
measuring the period of variability. Additionally, narrow Ha emission is
observed in late-time spectra, exhibiting periodic velocity shifts likely
originating from hydrogen gas stripped from a companion and accreted onto the
compact remnant. Results. We propose that SN 2015ap's significant light curve
modulation arise from accretion onto a neutron star as the remnant of SN
2015ap. Our multi-wavelength observations reveal a sinusoidal modulation with a
period of 8.4 days, confirmed by periodic variations in the Ha emission lines.
Traditional models of circumstellar medium interactions cannot account for
these features due to the unusually high ejection rates required. Using the
Taylor-Spruit dynamo model, we suggest that the interaction between accreting
matter and the neutron star's magnetosphere could account for the observed
periodic modulation. This implies assuming an ejecta-companion interaction
because the accretion from fallback ejecta alone would not produce the observed
modulation. The binary configuration, characterized by a separation of less

2502.2054,Study of the Use of Property Probes in an Educational Setting,"Context: Developing compilers and static analysis tools (""language tools"") is
a difficult and time-consuming task. We have previously presented *property
probes*, a technique to help the language tool developer build understanding of
their tool. A probe presents a live view into the internals of the compiler,
enabling the developer to see all the intermediate steps of a compilation or
analysis rather than just the final output. This technique has been realized in
a tool called CodeProber.
  Inquiry: CodeProber has been in active use in both research and education for
over two years, but its practical use has not been well studied. CodeProber
combines liveness, AST exploration and presenting program analysis results on
top of source code. While there are other tools that specifically target
language tool developers, we are not aware of any that has the same design as
CodeProber, much less any such tool with an extensive user study. We therefore
claim there is a lack of knowledge how property probes (and by extension
CodeProber) are used in practice.
  Approach: We present the results from a mixed-method study of use of
CodeProber in an educational setting, with the goal to discover if and how
property probes help, and how they compare to more traditional techniques such
as test cases and print debugging. In the study, we analyzed data from 11
in-person interviews with students using CodeProber as part of a course on
program analysis. We also analyzed CodeProber event logs from 24 students in
the same course, and 51 anonymized survey responses across two courses where
CodeProber was used.
  Knowledge: Our findings show that the students find CodeProber to be useful,
and they make continuous use of it during the course labs. We further find that
the students in our study seem to partially or fully use CodeProber instead of
other development tools and techniques, e.g. breakpoint/step-debugging, test
cases and print debugging.
  Grounding: Our claims are supported by three different data sources: 11
in-person interviews, log analysis from 24 students, and surveys with 51
responses.
  Importance: We hope our findings inspire others to consider live exploration

2503.09916,Type Information-Assisted Self-Supervised Knowledge Graph Denoising,"Knowledge graphs serve as critical resources supporting intelligent systems,
but they can be noisy due to imperfect automatic generation processes. Existing
approaches to noise detection often rely on external facts, logical rule
constraints, or structural embeddings. These methods are often challenged by
imperfect entity alignment, flexible knowledge graph construction, and
overfitting on structures. In this paper, we propose to exploit the consistency
between entity and relation type information for noise detection, resulting a
novel self-supervised knowledge graph denoising method that avoids those
problems. We formalize type inconsistency noise as triples that deviate from
the majority with respect to type-dependent reasoning along the topological
structure. Specifically, we first extract a compact representation of a given
knowledge graph via an encoder that models the type dependencies of triples.
Then, the decoder reconstructs the original input knowledge graph based on the
compact representation. It is worth noting that, our proposal has the potential
to address the problems of knowledge graph compression and completion, although
this is not our focus. For the specific task of noise detection, the
discrepancy between the reconstruction results and the input knowledge graph
provides an opportunity for denoising, which is facilitated by the type
consistency embedded in our method. Experimental validation demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach in detecting potential noise in real-world data.",['cs.LG'],"['Sun Jiaqi', 'Zheng Yujia', 'Dong Xinshuai', 'Dai Haoyue', 'Zhang Kun']",2025-03-12,,False
2502.05562,Can Large Language Models Be Query Optimizer for Relational Databases?,"Query optimization, which finds the optimized execution plan for a given
query, is a complex planning and decision-making problem within the
exponentially growing plan space in database management systems (DBMS).
Traditional optimizers heavily rely on a certain cost model constructed by
various heuristics and empirical tuning, probably leading to generating
suboptimal plans. Recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their potential in solving complex planning and decision-making
problems, such as arithmetic and programmatic tasks. In this paper, we try to
explore the potential of LLMs in handling query optimization and propose a
tentative LLM-based query optimizer dubbed LLM-QO, established on PostgreSQL's
execution engine. In LLM-QO, we formulate query optimization in an
autoregressive fashion which directly generates the execution plan without
explicit plan enumeration. To investigate the essential input of LLM-QO, we
design a customized data recipe named QInstruct to collect the training data
from various optimizers and serialize the database's meta data, queries and
corresponding plans into a textual format. Based on QInstruct, we implement a
two-stage fine-tuning pipeline, Query Instruction Tuning (QIT) and Query Direct
Preference Optimization (QDPO), to empower the capability of general-purpose
LLMs in handling query optimization. In our experiments, LLM-QO can generate
valid and high-quality plans and consistently outperforms both traditional and

be derived as query optimizers where generalization, efficiency and adaptivity

first-order phase transition expands with increasing density as suggested by
several studies, then, at very high densities, we may expect that the
first-order phase transition region expands into the heavy quark region of QCD,
where we can perform efficient large scale simulations by adopting an effective
theory of heavy quark QCD based on the hopping parameter expansion. In the
heavy quark region of QCD, we have another first-order phase transition region
around the heavy quark limit at zero density. By numerical simulations of
effective heavy quark QCD, we found that, the first-order transition at zero
density turns into a crossover as the chemical potential is increased, but,
when we increase the chemical potential further, the change in the plaquette
value near the crossover point becomes much steeper. This may be suggesting
reappearance of the first-order phase transition. In this talk, we first show
the nature of the phase transition of phase-quenched finite density QCD in the

Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language

Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very

This paper introduces APT-LLM, a novel embedding-based anomaly detection

  User Satisfaction Estimation in Dialogue","Understanding user satisfaction with conversational systems, known as User
Satisfaction Estimation (USE), is essential for assessing dialogue quality and
enhancing user experiences. However, existing methods for USE face challenges
due to limited understanding of underlying reasons for user dissatisfaction and
the high costs of annotating user intentions. To address these challenges, we
propose PRAISE (Plan and Retrieval Alignment for Interpretable Satisfaction
Estimation), an interpretable framework for effective user satisfaction
prediction. PRAISE operates through three key modules. The Strategy Planner
develops strategies, which are natural language criteria for classifying user
satisfaction. The Feature Retriever then incorporates knowledge on user
satisfaction from Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieves relevance features
from utterances. Finally, the Score Analyzer evaluates strategy predictions and
classifies user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate that PRAISE
achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks for the USE task.
Beyond its superior performance, PRAISE offers additional benefits. It enhances
interpretability by providing instance-level explanations through effective
alignment of utterances with strategies. Moreover, PRAISE operates more

the flux pumping, we choose realistic parameters, plasma configurations, and
source terms based on AUG experiments. During the initial saturation stage of
the unstable 1/1 quasi-interchange mode (on millisecond timescales), q_0
exhibits fast under-damped oscillation and reaches a value closer to unity,
which is attributed to the self-regulation of core plasma and the fast dynamo
effect on the order of V/m. On the longer resistive diffusion timescale of
seconds, the slow negative dynamo effect on the order of mV/m induced by the
1/1 MHD instability plays an effective role in flux pumping, which provides
quantitative agreement with experimental observations for the first time. The
final saturated 1/1 MHD instability exhibits features of the quasi-interchange
mode and tearing mode, and the associated convective plasma flow velocity is a
few m/s. The toroidal negative electric field from the slow dynamo dominantly
offsets the positive current drive and continuously redistributes the current
density and pressure. As a result, q_0 is maintained close to unity due to the
low-shear profiles of current density and pressure in the plasma core, and the

To tackle these limitations, we propose to borrow the weapon of large language

that the training corpora of LLMs contain extensive code changes and their
pairwise commit messages, which makes LLMs capture the knowledge about commits,

perform downstream tasks without model tuning. However, it remains unclear how

densities increase at most by a factor of $O(10)$ over its background value due
to the zonal flows' unsteady nature. Furthermore, dust feedback can impede the
formation of zonal flows, even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\epsilon \sim
O(0.1)$. We interpret this phenomenon as a competition between the negative gas
angular momentum flux associated with zonal flow formation and the positive
dust angular momentum flux associated with its drift towards pressure maxima.
Dust concentration significantly weakens when a large-scale radial pressure

appearance directly on the geometry or additionally use texture normals as part
of the appearance features. However, this requires detailed but inefficiently
large meshes, that would have to be simplified in a post-processing step, or
suffers from well-known limitations of normal maps such as missing shadows or
incorrect silhouettes. Another limiting factor is the fixed and typically low
resolution of the texture estimation resulting in loss of important surface
details. To overcome these problems, we present ROSA, an inverse rendering
method that directly optimizes mesh geometry with spatially adaptive mesh
resolution solely based on the image data. In particular, we refine the mesh
and locally condition the surface smoothness based on the estimated normal
texture and mesh curvature. In addition, we enable the reconstruction of fine

A scaling theory is developed for these properties, and their scaling relations

2502.11305,Non-Uniform Memory Sampling in Experience Replay,"Continual learning is the process of training machine learning models on a
sequence of tasks where data distributions change over time. A well-known
obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon in which a
model drastically loses performance on previously learned tasks when learning
new ones. A popular strategy to alleviate this problem is experience replay, in
which a subset of old samples is stored in a memory buffer and replayed with
new data. Despite continual learning advances focusing on which examples to
store and how to incorporate them into the training loss, most approaches
assume that sampling from this buffer is uniform by default.
  We challenge the assumption that uniform sampling is necessarily optimal. We
conduct an experiment in which the memory buffer updates the same way in every
trial, but the replay probability of each stored sample changes between trials
based on different random weight distributions. Specifically, we generate 50
different non-uniform sampling probability weights for each trial and compare
their final accuracy to the uniform sampling baseline. We find that there is
always at least one distribution that significantly outperforms the baseline
across multiple buffer sizes, models, and datasets. These results suggest that
more principled adaptive replay policies could yield further gains. We discuss
how exploiting this insight could inspire new research on non-uniform memory

as nodes to model complex face representations. However, these methods

problem that some latent relations are missing. These latent relations are
crucial for deep semantic representation of face aging. In this novel, we
propose a new Latent Relation-Aware Graph Neural Network with Initial and
Dynamic Residual (LRA-GNN) to achieve robust and comprehensive facial
representation. Specifically, we first construct an initial graph utilizing
facial key points as prior knowledge, and then a random walk strategy is
employed to the initial graph for obtaining the global structure, both of which
together guide the subsequent effective exploration and comprehensive
representation. Then LRA-GNN leverages the multi-attention mechanism to capture
the latent relations and generates a set of fully connected graphs containing
rich facial information and complete structure based on the aforementioned
guidance. To avoid over-smoothing issues for deep feature extraction on the
fully connected graphs, the deep residual graph convolutional networks are
carefully designed, which fuse adaptive initial residuals and dynamic
developmental residuals to ensure the consistency and diversity of information.

representation of intricate dependencies within the nodes. To address the

Concrete random variables are utilized to approximate the binary adjacency

2502.16889,"Unveiling Institution-Specific Bias in Pathology Foundation Models:
  Detriments, Causes, and Potential Solutions","Pathology foundation models (PFMs) extract valuable discriminative features
from images for downstream clinical tasks. PFMs have simplified the development
of deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve
diagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes
struggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are
often contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e.,
institution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination
can lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization
ability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first
reveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of
institution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts,
analyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions.
Specifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in
pathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant
information, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance
on contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This
indicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We
further delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific
information and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet
effective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This
study is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly
advanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire
future research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying
exclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.",['cs.CV'],"['Lin Weiping', 'Liu Shen', 'Zhu Runchen', 'Wang Liansheng']",2025-02-24,,False

They are are concerned with two conjectures made by Wolmer Vasconcelos: if the
conormal module of a local ring has finite projective dimension, or if the
module of differentials, taken over an appropriate field, has finite projective
dimension, then the ring must be complete intersection. The notes present an
accessible and self-contained account of the strongest results known at the
time in connection with these problems; this includes a number of ideas that
have not appeared elsewhere. In the last section, Herzog turns his attention to
the cotangent complex, and conjectures himself that if the cotangent complex of
a local ring has bounded homology groups, then the ring must be complete
intersection. Among other results, he proves that the conjecture holds for
local rings of characteristic zero over which all modules have rational
Poincar\'e series.

wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex
probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real
forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two
quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the
Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability
sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for
explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that
produces this so-called ""wave-like"" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective
also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental
concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of
quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of
stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the
appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum
behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a
probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic

  Approach: A 0.6cc air kerma (Kair) calibrated Farmer chamber measured Kair at
isocenter for five default CBCT protocols (HEAD, PELVIS, LARGE PELVIS, THORAX,
SPOTLIGHT) on a Varian TrueBeam linac. Imaging parameters were modified to
reduce cumulative exposure by reducing projections (by 25%, 50%, 75%) in FDK
reconstruction, or lowering single frame exposure by 25%, 50%, 70 to 75%. Cone
Beam Dose Index (CBDI) and weighted CBDI (CBDI_w) were measured in CTDI
phantoms to correlate with Kair. Image quality was assessed quantitatively (HU
linearity, uniformity, low-contrast visibility, high-contrast resolution,
spatial integrity) using Catphan604, and qualitatively via anthropomorphic
phantoms.
  Results: A linear relationship between Kair, CTDI, and CBDI_w was
established. High-contrast resolution and spatial integrity were unaffected by
dose reduction (R < 0.5), while low-contrast visibility strongly correlated
with exposure (R > 0.75). HU uniformity and linearity remained stable (<40 HU
deviation), except for LARGE PELVIS at <50% single-frame exposure. 80 to 50%

heavy demand of dense prediction tasks on large-scale well-annotated datasets,
especially for the challenging multi-organ segmentation (MoS). However, the
prevailing class-imbalance problem in MoS caused by the substantial variations

address this issue, in this paper, we propose an innovative semi-supervised

fashion of multi-task learning. Additionally, based on a mean teacher
framework, we elaborately design a balanced subclass regularization to utilize
the teacher predictions of SCS task to supervise the student predictions of MoS
task, thus effectively transferring unbiased knowledge to the MoS subnetwork
and alleviating the influence of the class-imbalance problem. Considering the
similar semantic information inside the subclasses and their corresponding
original classes (i.e., parent classes), we devise a semantic-conflict penalty
mechanism to give heavier punishments to the conflicting SCS predictions with
wrong parent classes and provide a more accurate constraint to the MoS
predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on two publicly available

surveys provide the largest cluster samples. Yet modeling the selection
function of such samples is complicated by non-cluster members projected along

these effects by cross-matching galaxy clusters selected in the Dark Energy
survey data with the \rdmpr$\,$ algorithm with significant detections in three
South Pole Telescope surveys (SZ, pol-ECS, pol-500d). For matched clusters, we
augment the \rdmpr$\,$catalog by the SPT detection significance. For unmatched

signature. Using a Bayesian population model applied to the collected
multi-wavelength data, we explore various physically motivated models to
describe the relationship between observed richness and halo mass. Our analysis
reveals the limitations of a simple lognormal scatter model in describing the
data. We rule out significant contamination by unvirialized objects at the
high-richness end of the sample. While dedicated simulations offer a

Here we analyze how spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the

potentiation/depression occurs strictly when presynaptic spikes precede/proceed
postsynaptic spikes, allow assemblies to remain distinct even with substantial
overlap in membership. This stability arises because causal STDP effectively
cancels the symmetric correlations introduced by common inputs from shared

2503.1872,On a mixed problem for the nonstationary Stokes system in an angle,"The autor considers an initial-boundary value problem for the nonstationary
Stokes system in an angle, where Dirichlet and Neumann conditions are
prescribed on the diferent sides of the angle. The major part of the paper
deals with the parameter-depending problem which arises after the application
of the Laplace transform. The author obtains existence, uniqueness and
regularity results for this problem in a class of weighted Sobolev spaces.
Using the properties of the Laplace transform, he proves the existence and
uniqueness of strong solutions of the time-dependent problem.",['math.AP'],['Rossmann Jürgen'],2025-03-24,,False
2502.16487,All That Glitters is Not Novel: Plagiarism in AI Generated Research,"Automating scientific research is considered the final frontier of science.
Recently, several papers claim autonomous research agents can generate novel
research ideas. Amidst the prevailing optimism, we document a critical concern:
a considerable fraction of such research documents are smartly plagiarized.
Unlike past efforts where experts evaluate the novelty and feasibility of
research ideas, we request $13$ experts to operate under a different
situational logic: to identify similarities between LLM-generated research
documents and existing work. Concerningly, the experts identify $24\%$ of the
$50$ evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one
methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These
reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers.
Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge
original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors. Lastly, through
controlled experiments we show that automated plagiarism detectors are
inadequate at catching deliberately plagiarized ideas from an LLM. We recommend
a careful assessment of LLM-generated research, and discuss the implications of
our findings on research and academic publishing.",['cs.CL'],"['Gupta Tarun', 'Pruthi Danish']",2025-02-23,,False
