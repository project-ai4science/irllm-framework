    "start_abstract":" Screening for lung cancer: 2023 guideline update from the American Cancer Society; Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of nodular lesions in the anterior mediastinum that had been found incidentally on screening chest computed tomography (CT) in asymptomatic subjects. Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced lung mortality. Our objective was update American Cancer Society (ACS) 2013 screening (LCS) guideline for adults at high risk cancer.

    "target_abstract":" Automated detection of anterior mediastinal nodular lesions (AMLs) has significance for clinical usage as it is challenging for radiologists to accurately identify AMLs from chest computed tomography (CT) imaging due to various factors, including poor resolution, variations in intensity and the similarity of the AMLs to other tissues. To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++. The proposed network employing attention mechanisms exhibited a promising result for segmenting AMLs from chest CT imaging and could be used to automate the AML detection process for achieving improved diagnostic reliability.",

To do so, we first identify and extract the key\nbitflip characteristics of RowHammer and RowPress from the device-level error\nmechanisms studied in prior works.

To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++. The proposed network employing attention mechanisms exhibited a promising result for segmenting AMLs from chest CT imaging and could be used to automate the AML detection process for achieving improved diagnostic reliability.",

Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women.

The second failing of Chameleon2 is that it lacks\ntransparency and it does not provide the fine-tuned algorithm parameters used\nto obtain the claimed results. We meticulously provide all such parameter\nvalues to enhance replicability.\n  The improvement which we make in Chameleon2 is that we replace the exact\n$k$-NN search with an approximate $k$-NN search. This further reduces the\nalgorithmic complexity down to $O(n\\log{n})$ without any performance loss.\nHere, we primarily configure three approximate nearest neighbor search\nalgorithms (Annoy, FLANN and NMSLIB) to align with the overarching Chameleon2\nclustering framework.

(2)The Attention module of Transformer\nneural network is integrated into the LSTM neural network to form the new\nLSTM-Transformer Model to predict the pulsation time characteristic points for\nadjusting the motor speed of the pVAD. Results: The AP-pVAD Model is validated\nin three hydraulic experiments and an animal experiment. (1)The pressure\nprovided by pVAD calculated with the NPQ Model has a maximum error of only 2.15\nmmHg compared to the expected values. (2)The pulsation time characteristic\npoints predicted by the LSTM-Transformer Model shows a maximum prediction error\nof 1.78ms, which is significantly lower than other methods. (3)The in-vivo test\nof pVAD in animal experiment has significant improvements in aortic pressure.\nAnimals survive for over 27 hours after the initiation of pVAD operation.\nConclusion: (1)For a given pVAD, motor speed has a linear relationship with\npressure and a quadratic relationship with flow. (2)Deep learning can be used\nto predict pulsation characteristic time points, with the LSTM-Transformer\nModel demonstrating minimal prediction error and better robust performance\nunder conditions of limited dataset sizes, elevated noise levels, and diverse\nhyperparameter combinations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.",

For\nonline learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the\nregret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost)\nover time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the\nsingle optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant\ndifference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions\nmade in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about\nthe input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a\nfixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature\nresults are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori\nassuming certain signals are bounded.

        "the traceability of\nthe selection mechanism execution and 2) the coordination among the selected\nUAVs, which is currently offered in a centralized manner and is not coupled\nwith the relay selection. Existing UAV coordination methods often rely on\noptimization methods, which are not adaptable to different environment\ncomplexities, or on centralized deep reinforcement learning, which lacks\nscalability in multi-UAV settings. Overall, there is a need for a comprehensive\nframework where relay selection and coordination are coupled and executed in a\ntransparent and trusted manner. This work proposes a framework empowered by\nreinforcement learning and Blockchain for UAV-assisted IoV networks. It\nconsists of three main components: a two-sided UAV relay selection mechanism\nfor UAV-assisted IoV, a decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(MDRL) model for autonomous UAV coordination, and a Blockchain implementation\nfor transparency and traceability in the interactions between vehicles and\nUAVs. The relay selection considers the two-sided preferences of vehicles and\nUAVs based on the Quality-of-UAV (QoU) and the Quality-of-Vehicle (QoV). Upon\nselection of relay UAVs, the decentralized coordination between them is enabled\nthrough an MDRL model trained to control their mobility and maintain the\nnetwork coverage and connectivity using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The\nevaluation results demonstrate that the proposed selection and coordination\nmechanisms improve the stability of the selected relays and maximize the\ncoverage and connectivity achieved by the UAVs.",

        "the traceability of\nthe selection mechanism execution and 2) the coordination among the selected\nUAVs, which is currently offered in a centralized manner and is not coupled\nwith the relay selection. Existing UAV coordination methods often rely on\noptimization methods, which are not adaptable to different environment\ncomplexities, or on centralized deep reinforcement learning, which lacks\nscalability in multi-UAV settings. Overall, there is a need for a comprehensive\nframework where relay selection and coordination are coupled and executed in a\ntransparent and trusted manner. This work proposes a framework empowered by\nreinforcement learning and Blockchain for UAV-assisted IoV networks. It\nconsists of three main components: a two-sided UAV relay selection mechanism\nfor UAV-assisted IoV, a decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(MDRL) model for autonomous UAV coordination, and a Blockchain implementation\nfor transparency and traceability in the interactions between vehicles and\nUAVs. The relay selection considers the two-sided preferences of vehicles and\nUAVs based on the Quality-of-UAV (QoU) and the Quality-of-Vehicle (QoV). Upon\nselection of relay UAVs, the decentralized coordination between them is enabled\nthrough an MDRL model trained to control their mobility and maintain the\nnetwork coverage and connectivity using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The\nevaluation results demonstrate that the proposed selection and coordination\nmechanisms improve the stability of the selected relays and maximize the\ncoverage and connectivity achieved by the UAVs.",

The main idea is to use KNN-PTV to enhance the spatial resolution of\nflow fields by blending data from \\textit{locally similar} flow regions\navailable in the time series. This \\textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of\nstatistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD\ndirectly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a\ngrid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products.\nLastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered\ndistributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that\nincorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does\nnot require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus\nproviding flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is\nvalidated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three\nkey aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. The proposed method is\nevaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN-PTV, and c-RBFs. The\nresults demonstrate improved accuracy, with an average error on the order of\n11%, compared to 13-14% for the other methods. Additionally, the proposed\nmethod achieves an increase in the cutoff frequency of approximately 3-4\/D,\ncompared to the values observed in the competing approaches.

Our approach first shrinks the\npotentially unbounded constraint set compact in a data-adaptive way, obtains\nsamples of the relevant test statistic inside this set to estimate a quantile\nfunction, and then uses these computed quantities to produce the intervals. Our\ndata-adaptive bounding approach is based on the approach by Berger and Boos\n(1994), and involves defining a subset of the constraint set where the true\nparameter exists with high probability. This probabilistic guarantee is then\nincorporated into the final coverage guarantee in the form of an uncertainty\nbudget. We then propose custom sampling algorithms to efficiently sample from\nthis subset, even when the parameter space is high-dimensional.\nOptimization-based interval methods formulate confidence interval computation\nas two endpoint optimizations, where the optimization constraints can be set to\nachieve different types of interval calibration while seamlessly incorporating\nparameter constraints. However, choosing valid optimization constraints has\nbeen elusive. We show that all four proposed intervals achieve nominal coverage\nfor a particular functional both theoretically and in practice, with numerical\nexamples demonstrating superior performance of our intervals over the OSB\ninterval in terms of both coverage and expected length. In particular, we show\nthe superior performance in a realistic unfolding simulation from high-energy\nphysics that is severely ill-posed and involves a rank-deficient forward model.",

Our approach first shrinks the\npotentially unbounded constraint set compact in a data-adaptive way, obtains\nsamples of the relevant test statistic inside this set to estimate a quantile\nfunction, and then uses these computed quantities to produce the intervals. Our\ndata-adaptive bounding approach is based on the approach by Berger and Boos\n(1994), and involves defining a subset of the constraint set where the true\nparameter exists with high probability. This probabilistic guarantee is then\nincorporated into the final coverage guarantee in the form of an uncertainty\nbudget. We then propose custom sampling algorithms to efficiently sample from\nthis subset, even when the parameter space is high-dimensional.\nOptimization-based interval methods formulate confidence interval computation\nas two endpoint optimizations, where the optimization constraints can be set to\nachieve different types of interval calibration while seamlessly incorporating\nparameter constraints. However, choosing valid optimization constraints has\nbeen elusive. We show that all four proposed intervals achieve nominal coverage\nfor a particular functional both theoretically and in practice, with numerical\nexamples demonstrating superior performance of our intervals over the OSB\ninterval in terms of both coverage and expected length. In particular, we show\nthe superior performance in a realistic unfolding simulation from high-energy\nphysics that is severely ill-posed and involves a rank-deficient forward model.",

This \\textit{similarity} is assessed in terms of\nstatistical coherency with leading features, identified by meshless POD\ndirectly on the scattered data without the need to first interpolate onto a\ngrid, but instead relying on RBFs to compute all the relevant inner products.\nLastly, the proposed approach uses the c-RBF on the denser scattered\ndistributions to derive an analytical representation of the flow fields that\nincorporates physical constraints. This combination is meshless because it does\nnot require the definition of a grid at any step of the calculation, thus\nproviding flexibility in handling complex geometries. The algorithm is\nvalidated on 3D measurements of a jet flow in air. The assessment covers three\nkey aspects: statistics, spectra, and modal analysis. The proposed method is\nevaluated against standard Particle Image Velocimetry, KNN-PTV, and c-RBFs. The\nresults demonstrate improved accuracy, with an average error on the order of\n11%, compared to 13-14% for the other methods. Additionally, the proposed\nmethod achieves an increase in the cutoff frequency of approximately 3-4\/D,\ncompared to the values observed in the competing approaches.

Using linear stability analysis near\nstagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R\nplane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify\nadditional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the\ntraditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is\nincluded, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full\nnonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle\nbehaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions,\nconsistent with Nath et al.

For example,\nPavi\\v{c}i{\\'c} adds 75 observables to the original 117-observable KS set.\nBeyond terminology, there are fundamental physical reasons for focusing on the\noriginal KS sets. One reason is that, for experimentally observing quantum\nstate-independent contextuality, there is no need to measure the observables\nadded in the extended sets. Another reason is that, to produce bipartite\nperfect quantum strategies, or correlations in a face of the nonsignaling\npolytope with no local points, or correlations with nonlocal content 1, the two\nparties do not need to measure any of the observables added in the extended\nsets.

Classification results from all the three techniques were compared and it was observed that WFD performs better than FD and GFD technique.

        "] are ``wrong''. In all cases, Pavi\\v{c}i{\\'c}'s claims are\nbased on the fact that he is assuming a different definition of Kochen-Specker\n(KS) set. Adopting a terminology used by, e.g., Larsson, the sets that\nPavi\\v{c}i{\\'c} call KS sets can be called ``extended'' KS sets, since they are\nconstructed by adding observables to the ``original'' KS sets. For example,\nPavi\\v{c}i{\\'c} adds 75 observables to the original 117-observable KS set.\nBeyond terminology, there are fundamental physical reasons for focusing on the\noriginal KS sets. One reason is that, for experimentally observing quantum\nstate-independent contextuality, there is no need to measure the observables\nadded in the extended sets. Another reason is that, to produce bipartite\nperfect quantum strategies, or correlations in a face of the nonsignaling\npolytope with no local points, or correlations with nonlocal content 1, the two\nparties do not need to measure any of the observables added in the extended\nsets.

The Euclidean distance has been calculated as a similarity measure parameter for shape classification. For WFD technique, a Mexican-hat wavelet function was used. Classification results from all the three techniques were compared and it was observed that WFD performs better than FD and GFD technique.

But the more Buenrostro looked at the DNA, the more differences he found in how it was packaged1. \u201cI realized that there were probably hundreds of flavours,\u201d recalls Buenrostro, who was a graduate student at Stanford University in California at the time.",

        "The integration of differential privacy into personalized\nfederated learning lacks sufficient personalization, leading to the\nintroduction of excessive noise into the model. (2) It fails to adequately\ncontrol the spatial scope of model update information, resulting in a\nsuboptimal balance between data privacy and model effectiveness in differential\nprivacy federated learning. In this paper, we propose a differentially private\npersonalized federated learning approach that employs dynamically sparsified\nclient updates through reparameterization and adaptive norm(DP-pFedDSU).\nReparameterization training effectively selects personalized client update\ninformation, thereby reducing the quantity of updates. This approach minimizes\nthe introduction of noise to the greatest extent possible. Additionally,\ndynamic adaptive norm refers to controlling the norm space of model updates\nduring the training process, mitigating the negative impact of clipping on the\nupdate information. These strategies substantially enhance the effective\nintegration of differential privacy and personalized federated learning.\nExperimental results on EMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our\nproposed scheme achieves superior performance and is well-suited for more\ncomplex personalized federated learning scenarios.",

We\nfind that prior approaches using Transformers fail to meet these criteria, and\nidentify limitations present in existing architectures and training procedures.\nFirst, we show that softmax Transformers struggle to perform high-precision\nmultiplications, which prevents them from precisely learning numerical\nalgorithms. Second, we identify an alternate class of architectures, comprised\nentirely of polynomials, that can efficiently represent high-precision gradient\ndescent iterates. Finally, we investigate precision bottlenecks during training\nand address them via a high-precision training recipe that reduces stochastic\ngradient noise. Our recipe enables us to train two polynomial architectures,\ngated convolutions and linear attention, to perform gradient descent iterates\non least squares problems. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability to\ntrain to near machine precision. Applied iteratively, our models obtain\n100,000x lower MSE than standard Transformers trained end-to-end and they incur\na 10,000x smaller generalization gap on out-of-distribution problems.
