Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced lung mortality. Our objective was update American Cancer Society (ACS) 2013 screening (LCS) guideline for adults at high risk cancer.

    "target_abstract":" Automated detection of anterior mediastinal nodular lesions (AMLs) has significance for clinical usage as it is challenging for radiologists to accurately identify AMLs from chest computed tomography (CT) imaging due to various factors, including poor resolution, variations in intensity and the similarity of the AMLs to other tissues. To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++. The proposed network employing attention mechanisms exhibited a promising result for segmenting AMLs from chest CT imaging and could be used to automate the AML detection process for achieving improved diagnostic reliability.",

In this article, we first represent the\nBethe ansatz equations of spin strings in terms of the FES equations of\ndifferent species. Then we show that the 1D spin XXX chain remarkably possesses\nthe non-mutual FES in the critical region. We observe that the equation of\nstate in terms of the FES gives rises to full statistical properties of the\nmodel at quantum criticality, which are in good agreement with the results\nobtained from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations of the model. From\nthe non-mutual FES, we also precisely determine the quantum scaling functions,\nwhich further agree well with the previous TBA results [Phys. Rev. B 96,\n220401(R) (2017)]. Finally, we also build up an exact mapping between the\nscaling functions of the Lieb-Liniger model and the spin Heisenberg spin chain\nat quantum criticality.

To assist radiologists in AML detection from chest CT imaging, a UNet-based computer-aided detection (CADe) system is proposed to segment AMLs from slice images of the chest CT scans. The proposed network adopts a modified UNet architecture. To guide the proposed network to selectively focus on AMLs and potentially disregard others in the image, different attention mechanisms are utilized in the proposed network, including the self-attention mechanism and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM). The proposed network was trained and evaluated on 180 chest CT scans which consist of 180 AMLs. 90 AMLs were identified as thymic cysts, and 90 AMLs were diagnosed as thymoma. The proposed network achieved an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.23 with 5-fold cross-validation, for which the mean Intersection over Union (IoU), sensitivity and specificity were 90.29, 93.98 and 95.68 respectively. Our method demonstrated an improved segmentation performance over state-of-the-art segmentation networks, including UNet, ResUNet, TransUNet and UNet++. The proposed network employing attention mechanisms exhibited a promising result for segmenting AMLs from chest CT imaging and could be used to automate the AML detection process for achieving improved diagnostic reliability.",

Methods We included 56,358 consecutive participants (mean age 52.4 \u00b1 10.5 years; male-female ratio 35,306:21,052) who underwent a baseline low-dose chest CT scan as part of a health checkup from 2006 through 2013. After the presence of anterior mediastinal nodular lesion had been confirmed, their CT findings, confirmatory diagnosis, and interval CT scan were reviewed. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was calculated on the basis of the Republic of Korea cancer statistics for 2014. Results Of the 56,358 participants, 413 (0.73%) had lesions (95% confidence interval: 0.66\u20130.80%); the prevalence increased with age (p <0.001) and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.; Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality and person\u2010years life lost from among US men women.

        "and a history of malignancy (p = 0.005). Of the lesions, 85.2% were smaller than 2 cm, 61.3% were round, and 80.2% had CT attenuation higher than 20 Hounsfield units. Among 51 proven cases, 39 lesions (76.9%) were benign and 12 (23.1%) were malignant. The standardized prevalence ratio for thymic epithelial tumor was 2.04 (95% confidence interval: 1.01\u20133.42). Of 11 resected thymic epithelial tumors, five were carcinomas, 10 were stage I or II, and all were completely resected without recurrence. Of the 237 unconfirmed cases with a follow-up CT scan, 82.2% were stable, 8.9% had increased, and the other 8.9% had decreased. Conclusions The prevalence of incidental nodular lesion was 0.73%. Most lesions had CT features that were indistinguishable from thymic epithelial tumors, but a considerable portion of the lesions were suspected to be benign. Incidental thymic epithelial tumors were more prevalent than clinically detected tumors, were early-stage cancer, and showed favorable outcomes.",

Finally, we explore\noptimal LRCs derived from elliptic function fields and extend a single\ncoordinate of such codes. This approach leads us to confirm that the new codes\nare also optimal, thereby allowing their lengths to reach $q + 2\\sqrt{q} - 2r -\n2$ with locality $r$. We also consider the construction of optimal $(r, 3)$-LRC\nin elliptic function fields, with exploring one more condition.",

In this paper, we conducted the first\nlarge-scale empirical analysis of 319,166 liquidity pools across six major\ndecentralized exchanges (DEXs) since 2018. We identified 3,117 SLID affected\nliquidity pools, resulting in cumulative losses of more than US$103 million. We\npropose a rule-based heuristic and an enhanced machine learning model for early\ndetection. Our machine learning model achieves a detection speed 4.77 times\nfaster than the heuristic while maintaining 95% accuracy. Our study establishes\na foundation for protecting DeFi investors at an early stage and promoting\ntransparency in the DeFi ecosystem.",

Given such RSL rules and a program to scan, MeCheck\ninterprets rules as cross-file static analyzers, which analyzers scan Java\nand\/or XML files to gather information and look for consistency violations. For\nevaluation, we studied the Spring and JUnit documentation to manually define 15\nrules, and created 2 datasets with 115 open-source EAs. The first dataset\nincludes 45 EAs, and the ground truth of 45 manually injected bugs. The second\ndataset includes multiple versions of 70 EAs. We observed that MeCheck\nidentified bugs in the first dataset with 100% precision, 96% recall, and 98%\nF-score.

We also show that a\nspecial Hopf $G$-triplet yields the invariant from Hopf $G$-algebras described\nby Mochida, thus generalizing the construction.",

We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety.

Although CFBD has demonstrated improved trial efficiency by\nusing fewer patients while maintaining high accuracy in identifying the MTD, it\nmay artificially inflate the effective sample sizes for the updated prior\ndistributions, particularly at the lowest and highest dose levels.

We find\nthat a Stokeslet, or point-particle, approximation is insufficient to\naccurately describe the instability and that the corrections provided by the\nfirst-reflection are necessary for obtaining some crucial dynamical features.\nAs opposed to a sharp boundary between exponential growth and neutral\neigenvalues under the Stokeslet approximation, the first-reflection correction\nleads to exponential growth for all initial perturbations, but far more rapid\nalgebraic growth than exponential growth at large lattice spacing $d$. For\ndiscs with aspect ratio 0.125, corresponding to the experimental value, the\ninstability growth rate is found to decrease with increasing lattice spacing\n$d$, approximately as $d^{-4.5}$, which is faster than the $d^{-2}$ for spheres\n(Crowley, 1971).

Key characteristics of typical\ndisease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through\na caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular,\nlaryngeal, and cervical involvement. Although KMT2B-related disease is emerging\nas one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains\nto be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort\nof 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their\nclinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease\npresentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup\nof patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to\nthe previously reported systemic features, our study has identified\nco-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth\nretardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in\ntandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal\ndeletions and protein-truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of\nsystemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense\nvariants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after\ninsertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median\nage at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5 to 37.0 years).\nFollow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years.\nSignificant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the\nBurke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident\nat 6 months, 1 year, and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P =\n0.012",

        ". We find that the dust temperature (and opacity)\nincreases at the center (r<216 pc) of the galaxy up to $T_d=73-88$ K, and\npotentially up to $T_d<149$ K at r<110 pc. The combination of the resolved and\nintegrated FIR Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) further reveal a dust\ntemperature gradient and a significant contribution of the AGN hot dust torus\nat $\\nu_{\\rm{obs}}\\gtrsim 700$ GHz. By taking into account the torus\ncontribution and resolved optically-thick emission, we derive a total infrared\nluminosity ($L_{TIR}=8.78\\pm0.10)\\times 10^{12}L_\\odot$) and corresponding\nstar-formation rate (SFR$=1307\\pm15\\ M_\\odot\\ \\rm{yr}^{-1}$), that are at least\na factor $\\sim 3.6$ ($\\sim0.56$ dex) lower than previous measurements assuming\noptically-thin emission. We compare the resolved dust temperature, mass and IR\nluminosity profiles to simulations where they are only reproduced by models in\nwhich the AGN radiation heats the dust in the center of the galaxy. Our\nobservations provide evidence that dust in J2348--3054 cannot be assumed to be\nuniformly cold and optically thin. Whether J2348-3054 is representative of the\nlarger population of high-redshift quasars and galaxies remains to be\ndetermined with dedicated high-resolution and high-frequency ALMA observations.",

Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order\n(LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity.\nLikewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as\nexpected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast\nto the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR\nrelaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing\ntemperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However,\nat low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity\nand spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further\nloss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the\npersistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from\na fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin\nrelaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other\nprobes. It appears that the main effect of Ru-substitution is to shift the LRO\nto a higher temperature in comparison with Ag3LiIr2O6, though there are\nsignatures of a novel phase below about 10 K.",

These results underscore that sex has a\nfundamental influence on cardiac morphology, which may have important clinical\nimplications for differing cardiac structural assessments in men and women.\nFuture work should investigate how these anatomical differences manifest in\nvarious cardiovascular conditions, ultimately paving the way for more precise\nrisk stratification and personalized therapeutic strategies for both men and\nwomen.",

The distance of each dual graph to the center\nof the RNA-like cluster represents the likelihood of it belonging to RNA\nstructures. From validation, our PSG-based RNA-like cluster includes 97.3% of\nthe 121 known RNA dual graphs, suggesting good performance.

To determine which dual graphs in the 99.89% hypothetical set are\nmore likely to be associated with RNA structures, we apply computational\ntopology descriptors using the Persistent Spectral Graphs (PSG) method to\ncharacterize each graph using 19 PSG-based features and use clustering\nalgorithms that partition all possible dual graphs into two clusters, RNA-like\ncluster and non-RNA-like cluster. The distance of each dual graph to the center\nof the RNA-like cluster represents the likelihood of it belonging to RNA\nstructures. From validation, our PSG-based RNA-like cluster includes 97.3% of\nthe 121 known RNA dual graphs, suggesting good performance. Furthermore,\n46.017% of the hypothetical RNAs are predicted to be RNA-like. Significantly,\nwe observe that all the top 15 RNA-like dual graphs can be separated into\nmultiple subgraphs, whereas the top 15 non-RNA-like dual graphs tend not to\nhave any subgraphs. Moreover, a significant topological difference between top\nRNA-like and non-RNA-like graphs is evident when comparing their topological\nfeatures.

The rim of the Bar shows very\ncorrugated structures made of small-scale H2 dissociation fronts (DFs). The\n[CI] 609 um emission peaks very close (~0.002 pc) to the main H2-emitting DFs,\nsuggesting the presence of gas density gradients. These DFs are also bright and\nremarkably similar in C2H emission, which traces \"hydrocarbon radical peaks\"\ncharacterized by very high C2H abundances, reaching up to several x10^-7. The\nhigh abundance of C2H and of related hydrocarbon radicals, such as CH3, CH2,\nand CH, can be attributed to gas-phase reactions driven by elevated\ntemperatures, the presence of C+ and C, and the reactivity of FUV-pumped H2.\nThe hydrocarbon radical peaks roughly coincide with maxima of the 3.4\/3.3 um\nAIB intensity ratio, a proxy for the aliphatic-to-aromatic content of PAHs.\nThis implies that the conditions triggering the formation of simple\nhydrocarbons also favor the formation (and survival) of PAHs with aliphatic\nside groups, potentially via the contribution of bottom-up processes in which\nabundant hydrocarbon radicals react in situ with PAHs. Ahead of the DFs, in the\natomic PDR zone (where [H]>>[H2]), the AIB emission is the brightest, but small\nPAHs and carbonaceous grains undergo photo-processing due to the stronger FUV\nfield. Our detection of trace amounts of C2H in this zone may result from the\nphotoerosion of these species. This study provides a spatially resolved view of\nthe chemical stratification of key carbon carriers in a PDR. Overall, both\nbottom-up and top-down processes appear to link simple hydrocarbon molecules\nwith PAHs in molecular clouds",

Bulk magnetic susceptibility suggests long-range order\n(LRO)at T~20 K, whereas no clear signature is present in the heat capacity.\nLikewise, there is a loss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity around T~20 K as\nexpected at the onset of LRO, but a complete wipe-out is not seen in contrast\nto the result in Ag3LiIr2O6. There is also a T~20 K anomaly in the 7Li NMR\nrelaxation rate and also a fall in the 7Li NMR shift with decreasing\ntemperature. These results suggest LRO at T~20 K in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6. However,\nat low-T below 10 K, we observe a power law variation in magnetic heat capacity\nand spin lattice relaxation rate, temperature-independent-7K, and no further\nloss of the 7Li NMR spectral intensity. These results might suggest the\npersistence or stabilisation of a quantum spin liquid-like phase, perhaps from\na fraction of the sample in Ag3LiIr1.4Ru0.6O6 below 10 K. Our muon spin\nrelaxation measurements suggest ordering around 20 K, consistent with our other\nprobes.

To address these problems, we propose ForestSplats, a novel\napproach that leverages the deformable transient field and a superpixel-aware\nmask to efficiently represent transient elements in the 2D scene across\nunconstrained image collections and effectively decompose static scenes from\ntransient distractors without VFM.

        "$ time. In their influential 1989 text, Gusfield and\nIrving posed the question of whether $\\Omega(n^2)$ time is required for SR\nsolvability -- the task of deciding if an SR instance admits a stable matching.\n  In this paper we provide an affirmative answer to Gusfield and Irving's\nquestion. We show that any (randomized) algorithm that decides SR solvability\nrequires $\\Omega(n^2)$ adaptive Boolean queries to the agents' preferences (in\nexpectation). Our argument follows from a reduction from the communication\ncomplexity of the set disjointness function. The query lower bound implies\nquadratic time lower bounds for Turing machines, and memory access lower bounds\nfor random access machines. Thus, we establish that Irving's algorithm is\noptimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in a very strong sense.",

Classification results from all the three techniques were compared and it was observed that WFD performs better than FD and GFD technique.

This study is among the first to utilize two separate JWST\nobservations, from Cycle 1 ERS (July 2022) and Cycle 2 (Sept. 2023), to measure\nWR140's dust kinematics and confirm its morphology. To measure the proper\nmotions and projected velocities of the dust shells, we performed a novel PSF\nsubtraction to reduce the effects of the bright diffraction spikes and\ncarefully aligned the Cycle 2 to the Cycle 1 images. At 7.7 $\\mu$m, through the\nbright feature common to 16 dust shells (C1), we find an average dust shell\nproper motion of $390\\pm29$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which equates to a projected\nvelocity of $2714\\pm188$ km s$^{-1}$ at a distance of 1.64 kpc. Our measured\nspeeds are constant across all visible shells and consistent with previously\nreported dust expansion velocities. Our observations not only prove that these\ndusty shells are astrophysical (i.e., not associated with any PSF artifact) and\noriginate from WR140, but also confirm the \"clumpy\" morphology of the dust\nshells, in which identifiable substructures within certain shells persist for\nat least 14 months from one cycle to the next.

It\nbeats SIMD-optimized distance kernels on standard horizontal vector storage\n(avg 40% faster), only relying on scalar code that gets auto-vectorized. We\ncombined the PDX layout with recent dimension-pruning algorithms ADSampling\n[19] and BSA [52] that accelerate approximate vector search. We found that\nthese algorithms on the horizontal vector layout can lose to SIMD-optimized\nlinear scans, even if they are SIMD-optimized. However, when used on PDX, their\nbenefit is restored to 2-7x. We find that search on PDX is especially fast if a\nlimited number of dimensions has to be scanned fully, which is what the\ndimension-pruning approaches do. We finally introduce PDX-BOND, an even more\nflexible dimension-pruning strategy, with good performance on exact search and\nreasonable performance on approximate search.
